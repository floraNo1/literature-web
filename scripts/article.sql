Therefore, it is important to understand how MAR use affects cognitive behavior, as well as task and safety performance for better design and applications of MAR in construction. As a preliminary investigation, this study conducted laboratory simulations of rebar-inspection tasks and compared the cognitive load (CL), task performance (TP), and situational awareness (SA) of users of two types of MAR systems-i.e., head-mounted and handheld-against those of inspectors using traditional paper-based methods.

Concepts from information theory are used to discover the relationships between the variables and the model errors, which also serves as a mechanism to detect the predictability of the errors. The resulting information is used to select the best related input data for the error prediction model. The error prediction model is then trained and applied to improve the forecasts made by the physically based model. This approach was applied to a routing model of a 70 km reach of the River Wye, United Kingdom. The results demonstrate that errors from the physically based model show a consistent trend governed by some dynamics of their own, which can be modeled with learning algorithms. Errors were forecasted at different lead times. In all cases the forecasts made by the combined application of both models were more accurate than those made by the physically based model alone.

Using this approach, only the average condition of the local conditions can be represented. Most transient and changing signals will not be handled well due to the averaging effect of the technique. The Hilbert-Huang transform operates at the scale of every oscillation, an extremely important property for obtaining localized profile information. In this paper, the different algorithms of the Hilbert-Huang transform: empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble EMD, and complex EMD (CEMD) have been discussed and implemented to extract useful information from road profile data. The robustness of the algorithms is compared based on its ability to produce physically meaningful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which truly characterize the underlying process. The results show that although all the methodologies yielded similar residual trends, the CEMD produced physically meaningful and trusted IMFs whose information at the various levels of decomposition could be used to extract profile information such as the extent of deterioration and localized roughness information.', '', '4', '4', '2000-01-01 00:20:10', 24, 6);

A two-dimensional (2D) extension of EMD is used in this paper as a pavement distress image analytical tool. The algorithm decomposes an image into a set of narrow band components (called bidimensional intrinsic mode function, or BIMF) that uniquely reflect the variations in the image. Although some components could have good image edge characteristics, others might hold fidelity to the shape and size of objects or trends in the image. Therefore, the complete spatial and frequency characteristic of a desired image feature might also be divided into the different components, indicating that all attributes of a desired feature might not be found in a single component. An optimal solution requires image mining from the different component resolutions to accurately extract those specific attributes without compromising certain spatial and frequency characteristics. Two major contributions to pavement image analysis are achieved. First, the paper explores pavement image denoising or enhancement by combining the EMD and a weighted reconstruction technique as a tool for background standardization of images acquired under different types of illumination effects. Second, using principal component pursuit (PCP), the authors reconstruct a composite image by selecting salient information from coarse and fine resolution BIMFs useful for accurate extraction of linear patterns in a pavement distress image.

We argue that the use of instance segmentation algorithms has the theoretical potential to provide the output needed for the generation of gDTs. We solve instance segmentation in this paper through (1) using a CLOI-Instance graph connectivity algorithm that segments the point clusters of an object class into instances, and (2) boundary segmentation of points that improves Step 1. Our method was tested on the CLOI benchmark dataset and segmented instances with 76.25% average precision and 70% average recall per point among all classes.

The problem manifests itself as the optimization of total costs of construction projects that consist of indirect project costs and individual activity costs. The trade-off occurs as project duration and, as a result, indirect project costs decrease with reduced individual activity duration. This reduction in individual activity duration is achieved by increasing resource allocation to individual activities, which increases their costs to completion. Historically, metaheuristic solutions have been applied to small-scale problems due to computational complexities and requirements of larger networks. Findings in this article demonstrate that the metaheuristic approach is highly effective for solving large-scale construction TCT problems. A custom genetic algorithm (GA) is developed and used to solve large benchmark networks of up to 630 variables with high levels of accuracy (<3% deviation) consistently using computational power of a personal computer in less than 10 min. The same method can also be used to solve larger networks of up to 6,300 variables with reasonable accuracy (similar to 7% deviation) at the expense of longer processing times. A number of simple, yet effective, techniques that improve GA performance for TCT problems are demonstrated, the most effective of which is a novel problem encoding, based on weighted graphs, that enables the critical path problem to be partially solved for all candidate solutions a priori, thus significantly increasing fitness evaluation. Other improvements include parallel fitness evaluations, optimal algorithm parameters, and the addition of a stagnation criteria. This article also presents some guidelines of optimal algorithm parameter selection through a comprehensive parameter sweep and a computational demand profile analysis. Moreover, the methods proposed in this article are based on open source development projects that enable scalable solutions without significant development efforts.

A review of previous approaches to solve this problem reveals the deficiency of conventional optimization techniques and the suitability of genetic algorithm (GA) based models to handle such combinatorial optimization problems. Since GAs are computationally intensive optimization techniques, their application to large and complex problems is limited. The computational performance of a GA model can be improved by exploiting its inherent parallel nature. Accordingly, two parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) models are proposed in this study. The first is a global parallel virtual machine (PVM) parallel GA model where the fitness evaluation is done concurrently in a parallel processing environment using PVM libraries. The second is a global message passing interface (MPI) parallel GA model where an MPI environment substitutes for the PVM libraries.

To apply projection-based AR in the construction manufacturing facility, this paper proposes a framework that enables the user to perform a vision-based projection alignment using a projector and camera. The designated projection area determined by the user is marked out, the coordinates of which are then computed through segmentation and object-detection algorithms. After the acquisition of the markers\' coordinates is complete, a two-dimensional (2D) image is overlaid on the surface of the designated area using a projector by computing transformation matrix for the projection. To evaluate the potential performance in a field setting, the offset distances between the four corners of the projection boundary and the center of the markers are measured in various environments, such as at distances ranging from 5 to 8 m, and with different illumination conditions (i.e., low and high brightness) as well as in a manufacturing shop. The results indicate that average offset distances in all the experimental conditions are shorter than the factory tolerance level of 6.35 mm. Also, the statistical analysis reveals that both the distance and the illumination are significant factors affecting the projection alignment performance.

This paper is aimed at developing a new geometry-preserving active polygon (GPAP) model to address the over-evolution issue in the HAC model for improving the computation speed. The contributions of this paper include (1) proposing a new geometry-preserving evolution that ensures that the contour only evolves at its vertices instead of at every point along the edges; (2) tailoring a new energy function that enables a polygon to effectively converge to traffic sign regions without losing its geometry integrity by using both local color contrast feature and global elongation and rectangularity features; (3) proposing a generalized Hough transform that can make an efficient initial guess for the active polygon based on the manual for uniform traffic control devices (MUTCD) sign shape template with a multiscale implementation.

This leads to false negatives (i.e., missing detection of signs), which critically affect the system reliability and hinder the implementation of an automatic sign detection system. This paper presents this critical issue of reducing false negatives. A hybrid active contour (HAC) algorithm is proposed with a new energy function on the basis of unique traffic sign characteristics, including location probability distribution function (PDF), statistical color model (SCM), and global curve length, to detect traffic signs with DSIB problems. The proposed HAC algorithm can be incorporated seamlessly into the existing sign detection algorithms to take advantage of the capability of the existing system while adding the strength of the HAC algorithm. The focused test shows that the proposed HAC algorithm can correctly detect 92% of sign images with DSIB problems that could not be detected previously. Using actual video-log images provided by two transportation agencies (607 and 1,547 images, respectively), the general test shows that the enhanced HAC-incorporated sign detection system can effectively reduce false negatives yet not add an excessive number of false positives. The false-negative rates decreased 6.8% and 9.2%, respectively, with minimal increase of false-positive rates.

A lumped parameter macroscopic traffic flow model has been formulated, and using this model, a model-based estimation scheme has been designed based on the Kalman filtering technique. The only data required for implementing this method in the field are the flow passing the entry location and the spot speeds of vehicles passing through the entry and exit locations. The proposed method was corroborated using data measured from a road stretch in Chennai, and the performance was found to be satisfactory.', 'tajitha98@gmail.com; lelitha@iitm.ac.in; shankarram@iitm.ac.in', '8', '9', '2000-01-01 00:20:15', 29, 2);

In the government sector, the USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has implemented building information modeling (BIM) for bridge construction. Hence, state DOTs are now faced with heightened pressure in complying with the FHWA\'s Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) standardization. Although BIM can provide many benefits to DOTs, current BIM-based platforms for bridges are not fully developed to process traditional two-dimensional (2D) bridge drawings for BIM-based computational tasks involving existing bridges, for example cost estimation. Bridges are a critical infrastructure in any nation\'s economy, and by law the DOTs are tasked with ensuring that they remain safe for use. To maintain bridges, engineers currently perform periodic inspections, assessing each part of the bridge to identify areas that require maintenance. Maintenance work items are then generated for these areas; these are usually computed traditionally or by systems that still rely heavily on manual inputs. Such processes are time-consuming and cumbersome, and depend on years of bridge technical expertise. To overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy of processes such as generating maintenance work items for bridges, we propose a framework for automatically (1) processing existing 2D bridge drawings for bridges built pre-BIM adoption in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry; (2) converting these record drawings into three-dimensional (3D) information models; and (3) converting 3D information models into industry foundation class (IFC) files. The developed 3D models using the proposed framework were compared against developed 3D models using the state-of-the-art method. Experimental results show that the developed framework can be used in developing algorithms that generate 3D models and IFC output files from portable document format (PDF) bridge drawings in a semiautomated fashion.

The use of a centralized inspection database and bridge inspection reporting software has been explored by several state DOTs in recent years. During an inspection routine, the inspector visually assesses the condition of a particular bridge component. Based on a priori knowledge of the bridge components\' taxonomic hierarchy and ontology, the inspector navigates to the form corresponding to the component. The inspector then reports the component\'s condition to the database. Context-aware computing offers the possibility to make inspections more efficient by reducing the time required to navigate the software and the effort spent by inspectors to learn, remember, and recall the taxonomic hierarchy and ontology of bridge components. Context-aware computing leverages environmental variables, which define the inspector\'s context, and delivers streamlined information, pertinent to the task at hand, to assist decision making. This paper presents a computing framework that identifies the component of interest to the inspector and automatically queries the inspection database to retrieve information relevant to the component being assessed. The framework\'s run-time and space complexity are analyzed and presented. The uncertainty in sensing the inspector\'s location and line of sight are translated into errors in identifying the component of interest. Using a case study bridge, sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate and characterize the errors in identifying the component of interest due to the errors in tracking technologies through simulation studies and field testing. The sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the feasibility of employing global positioning systems (GPS) and magnetic compass technologies for location and line-of-sight tracking.

In this regard, a response parameter known as spectral moment is implemented for structural damage identification. The damage identification procedure starts with developing response power spectral density (PSD). The principal structural response features are then extracted from the frequency distribution of the spectrum using spectral moments. It is demonstrated that, although, spectral moment is a nonmodal characteristic of a process, it is related to modal parameters of a response signal since the spectral moment at each location is proportional to its corresponding modal vector. Hence, it is expected that due to damage occurrence spectral moment undergoes a variation. On this point, a damage sensitive feature is defined by comparing the spectral moments of two successive states of the structure. It is demonstrated that at a damage location there is a pronounced distinctive change in the indicative feature which is implemented for damage localization. The major advantages of the method include, first, the method works based on output-only measurement data, and second, it does not require any representative model of the structure and finally, unlike modal data that provides information at specific frequencies, the presented method is a broadband approach using information in a wide frequency range. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique was validated by numerical simulations and an experimental case study.

To improve collaboration efforts, the currently used radio systems-based interaction rnedium needs to be modified due to the impossibility of storing, retrieving, and transferring digital information, and limited support to implement information dissemination policies. This paper presents a reliable, transparent, and portable mobile ad hoc space for collaboration (MASC) based on a short range wireless communication platform to address these limitations in order to provide more consistent and efficient collaboration among first responders. The system was designed around a robust data redundancy core, and tested through software simulations and by conducting a search and rescue exercise involving civil engineers and firefighters. The simulation results highlight that the number of machines, the replication level, the size of the replication unit, and the wireless communication range are key design elements of the system in providing high availability. The search and rescue exercise allowed this research to confirm the high availability simulation results and to demonstrate that MASC is able to adequately manage and disseminate information in disaster scenarios.

In scheduling problems, chromosomes that are infeasible based on precedence relationships are typically penalized. This paper introduces a repair algorithm for the finance-infeasible chromosomes generated within the GA systems. The repair algorithm identifies the periods exhibiting finance needs that exceed the constrained cash, calculates the amounts of finance needs above the constraints, identifies the ongoing activities, selects randomly an activity for delaying its start time, determines the impact of the delay on the finance needs, and repeats the procedure until finance feasibility is attained. A 13-activity project was used to demonstrate the proposed repair algorithm. The performance of the repaired-chromosome GA system is evaluated through comparison against replaced-chromosome and penalized-chromosome GA systems using a fairly big project of 210 activities.

A transposed convolution layer is then used to upsample and resize the resulting prediction heatmap to the size of the input images, thus providing pixel-level predictions.

BIM data models capture the geometry as well as the semantics of buildings and its constituent parts in an object-oriented manner. They have been developed to achieve high-quality data exchange between software applications, reduce data loss, and increase interoperability. Across the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the open-data model industry foundation classes (IFC) has become a well-accepted standard. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a procedural language called the IFC procedural language (IFCPL) that can be easily embedded into an IFC-based building information model. This enables software developers to exchange procedural programs between different software applications in a platform-independent way using a neutral data format. IFCPL programs describe algorithms that operate on a set of input parameters and generate a set of output parameters (return values). The EXPRESS language, which is part of standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP), provides the concept of functions and rules for representing algorithmic knowledge. However, EXPRESS operates on the schema level, i.e., the rules and algorithms defined apply to all instances of the respective entity type in the same manner. IFCPL shifts this concept from the schema (class level) to the instance level and is not limited to realizing data integrity or attribute derivation. The paper describes in detail the features and the design of the IFCPL language. To illustrate its applicability, the language is used to demonstrate how transition curves of road or railway alignments can be described in a very flexible manner: IFCPL allows the definition and exchange of algorithms for computing the curve coordinates from general curve parameters. In doing so, software developers can dynamically define and exchange new transition curve types without modifying the IFC data model. At the same time, this approach helps avoid misinterpretations of informal curve descriptions. The procedural language provides a powerful option for adding enhancements and reduces software development costs by allowing semiautomated integration. Besides the alignment use case, there are many other application areas in which IFCPL can be used and where software developers as well as software users can benefit from it. They are discussed extensively throughout the paper.', 'julian.amann@tum.de; andre.borrmann@tum.de', '14', '14', '2000-01-01 00:20:16', 30, 5);

Therefore, recently researchers have begun developing predictive models of these behavioral interventions. However, limited consideration has been given to the importance that modeling assumptions (regarding social network type and structure) have in determining impact on intervention outcome. In this paper, an integrated model that combines established social-psychological principles of social influence and cultural norm diffusion with building social network profiles is developed and tested to examine the effect of social network type and structure on interventions. The writers apply agent-based modeling to simulate the interactions of heterogeneous building occupants in their respective social networks to examine the importance of social network type and structure for two interventions, as follows: (1)installing a peer energy-use feedback system, and (2)installing a feedback system and inserting an intervening agent into the building. The results indicate that network type and structure can have a significant effect on the time required for occupant energy-use intervention outcomes to reach a state of equilibrium.

In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic framework for modeling interdependent infrastructure networks. As part of this framework, we present our modeling approach and the accompanying sets of algorithms that enable the computationally efficient probabilistic modeling of large infrastructure systems considering interdependencies between networks. The proposed method creates a representative Bayesian network (BN) of the system, which provides exact inferences over the network compared to simulation-based approximations. With the traditional computational limitations of BNs to tens of parent component nodes per child system node, our generalized framework enables computationally efficient BN modeling of systems of, for example, hundreds of component nodes, including component-level performance and interdependent connections across networks. Our approach requires only simple inputs based on the basic component characteristics of location, type, connectivity, and initial failure probabilities. We modeled three types of interdependencies across the systemservice provision, geographic, and access for repair. We combined a minimum link set (MLS) formulation with the idea of supercomponents in order to reduce network complexity without any approximating assumptions. We present algorithms to efficiently identify MLSs and supercomponents, as well as to identify and remove any cyclic dependencies that arise across the network. Once the BN was constructed, we were able to perform exact inference analyses over a range of component state and hazard event scenarios in order to identify vulnerabilities across the network. The main novelty of the paper is to enable the probabilistic assessment of large, complex, interdependent infrastructure systems. We were able to consider performance from the component level and model hundreds of component nodes in a computationally efficient manner without approximating assumptions. We accounted for interdependencies between systems with exact inference results. The model can be used to investigate the potential for cascading failures and to prioritize critical components for repair, replacement, or reinforcement. We applied the proposed methodology and algorithms to the water distribution network in Atlanta, Georgia, and its dependencies with the power system.

The authors present a shuffled frog-leaping model to solve complex TCRO problems in construction project planning.

The proposed shuffled frog-leaping model considers the simultaneous optimization of three important objective functions in project planning: (1) minimizing total project duration, (2) total project cost, and (3) total variation of resource allocation. This model finds optimal Pareto fronts of project planning solutions in the three-dimensional space of total project duration, total project cost, and total variation of resource allocation.

Project activities can be interrupted and project resources can be reallocated to find more appropriate project planning solutions.

The low-bid method has been the most common competitive bid selection approach used for public projects in the US construction industry and worldwide. Although awarding the project to the lowest bid promises transparency in the selection process by considering only one objective criterion (the bid price), it often leads to adversarial relationships, less cooperation among different parties involved in the project, and potential compromise of the project quality. Furthermore, it is often accompanied by a significant number of claims and disputes that often result in cost overruns and schedule delays. Thus, there is a need to explore alternative competitive price-driven bidding methods which can preserve the transparency of the low-bid method and at the same time remedy the inconvenience of unrealistic low bids. This paper uses agent-based modeling to simulate the bidding process dynamics and to observe the long-term evolution of tendered prices and market equilibrium under different competitive tendering approaches including the second low, average, below-average, truncated average, and truncated below-average bidding methods. Whereas most previous bidding literature focused on the contractor\'s bidding decisions, this is the first study that addresses the owner\'s concern of choosing the most suitable bidding method for its current project and market conditions. This is achieved by analyzing how the bid criterion defined by each of the aforementioned bidding methods impacts the interaction among competing contractors and their bid price adaptation in the long term.

The demands at these pressure-deficient nodes cannot be fully satisfied. To make the analysis simple, it is generally assumed that the demand is fully satisfied irrespective of the pressure-head available and this approach is referred as demand-driven analysis. For simplicity, demand-driven analysis received great attention in the past and several computer packages are readily available for the analysis of normal operational water distribution network. On the other hand, head-driven or pressure-driven analysis could be effectively used to analyze the pressure-deficient condition as these methods consider the head-discharge relationship at every node. This paper presents a pressure-deficient analysis algorithm using the widely used demand-driven analysis-based solver. The proposed algorithm is validated through benchmark water distribution network and then extended period simulation is carried out for a multiple source pumped network. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm could find the partial nodal outflows and corresponding hydraulic-head values in a single hydraulic simulation run.

To track position and orientation of the users, prior research focused on radio frequency based location tracking methods, fiduciary markers, or parallel visual tracking and mapping techniques. These methods have potential in providing fast information access to field personnel, yet their application heavily depends on preinstalled infrastructure, may suffer from accumulated drift errors, and in the case of visual methods do not typically scale well. Furthermore, these methods do not provide content authoring capability in three dimensions, which is necessary for reciprocal application of augmented reality for field reporting and asynchronous personnel-to-personnel communications. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a scalable markerless and infrastructure-independent mobile augmented reality system for commodity smartphones and tablets, with client-server architecture and cloud computing basis, to facilitate both accessing to project information and conducting field reporting in three dimensions. The method relies on structure-from-motion point clouds generated from site images and/or videos to enable image-based localization and single-image based content authoring in three dimensions. By using mobile client devices with the proposed method, onsite personnel can associate field reports with two-dimensional (2D) patches from mobile images and store that information directly in the underlying three-dimensional (3D) point cloud model. In addition, the client-server architecture of the proposed system allows an onsite access to most updated project information and field reports as they are being documented on the server. The presented architecture also handles multiple onsite information retrieval and field reporting requests simultaneously. The overall system is validated on several indoor/outdoor work areas of three real-world construction projects with varying degrees of occlusions and lighting conditions. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method in prompt field reporting in three dimensions, minimizing the time field personnel spent on accessing project information, and communicating with others to resolve an issue/conflict on the jobsite within 1-3 min.

Currently, quality inspection is visually performed by inspectors, which can be costly and unreliable. This study thus proposes a vision-based approach to off-site quality inspection that reconstructs (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds using a projector-camera system and computes the deviations between scans and virtual model to generate error maps for quality assessment. Particularly, an experimental investigation is carried out to evaluate operational conditions (e.g., distance, illumination, and the size of point cloud data) for an understanding of the practical application from a technical viewpoint. The results demonstrated that the 3D reconstruction performance has an inverse relationship with illumination levels and statistically significant differences between projection distances. It is also observed that using an optimal number of points for registration reduces the considerable computational cost with no negative impact on registration accuracy. In the experiment, for instance, 3D registration of a mock-up model (e.g., 300,000 points) using an optimal number of sampled points (e.g., 500 points in this study) produced an RMSE of 2.462 mm and took 4 s. The results also indicate that the method achieved an inspection accuracy within 7 mm in dimension errors and correct detection of missing parts.

Qualitative design criteria related to architectural or constructability requirements, however, are not typically considered. This paper presents a preference-prediction model that evaluates user preference as an explicit design objective in the topology and geometry optimization of roof trusses. During optimization, each truss design is characterized by using a set of nine quantifiable features. A trained neural network inputs the characteristic truss feature values for each proposed design and outputs an integer value that indicates the user\'s preference for that design. To reduce the number of user interactions required to collect the required neural network training data, a Kohonen self-organizing map clusters designs into groups on the basis of feature similarities. Clustering allows users to indicate preferences for groups of similar trusses instead of for individual trusses. A rough-set reduct technique removes outliers from the user-preferred truss groups before the feature information and user preference assignments are used to train the predictive back-propagation neural network. The preference-prediction model is implemented in an existing multiobjective optimization program to determine the benefits of including satisfaction of user preferences as a design objective. Trial results indicate that more Pareto-optimal designs are identified, which increases the extent of the front, when user preferences are stated. Also, the Pareto-optimal set includes designs that have features reflecting the imposed user preferences and features that are structurally optimal. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000145.

Dimensional adaptation involes the solution of a set of linear and non-linear constraints describing the geometry of structural and architectural abstractions of a building. Integrated solutions are produced because different abstractions are related in terms of dimensions. The present paper describes how CADRE is able to manipulate potentially thousands of geometric constraints that describe complex objects such as buildings.

Today\'s practices mainly involve manual data collection and analysis, which have to be done for millions of miles of roads and the practice needs to be repeated regularly. While significant progress has been made on improving the data collection practice by leveraging video streams collected from car-mounted cameras, the analysis has primarily remained a manual and labor-intensive process. Automating the analysis from the collected videos is also challenging due to the interclass variability of traffic signs, expected changes in illumination, occlusion, sign position, and orientation. To address these challenges, this paper presents and evaluates the performance of three computer vision algorithms for detection and classification of traffic signs in presence of cluttered backgrounds and static and dynamic occlusions. The task particularly focuses on (1)extracting two-dimensional (2D) candidate windows from already collected video streams that potentially contain traffic signs-without making any prior assumption about their locations; (2)detecting the presence of signs in these 2D candidate windows; and (3)classifying them into warning, regulatory, stop, and yield sign categories based on their shape and color. For validation, a new comprehensive benchmark data set of over 11,000 annotated U.S. traffic sign images with a large range of pose, scale, background, illumination, and occlusion variation is introduced.

Workers, equipment, materials, temporary facilities, and the developing structure share the limited jobsite space during the construction period. Multiple types of spaces for different purposes on various locations are required to execute various activities at different times. Hence, space planning helps provide a safe and productive environment. Planners mentally link two-dimensional (2D) drawings and execution schedules to generate dynamic multiple types of space requirements, which is a complex task. Therefore, researchers suggest the use of four-dimensional (4D) modeling and building information modeling (BIM) for space planning. Both simulate the construction process by linking the execution schedule with a three-dimensional (3D) model to visualize the construction sequence in space planning. However, both still lack features such as topography modeling and geospatial analysis, which affect space planning. In this work, 4D geographic information systems (GIS) were used for space planning that facilitates topographic modeling, different types of geospatial analyses, and database management. GIS was also used to generate multiple types of spaces corresponding to various activities. A feature attribute table (FAT) associated with each space describes when, where, and how long that space will be required on the jobsite. GIS-based area topology was implemented through a set of validation rules that define how working areas have to share the jobsite. A GIS-based methodology that enables space planning, time-space conflict identification, and conflict resolution prior to the construction was developed and implemented.

The ability of GIS to maintain spatial data (i.e., 3D components corresponding to each activity) in separate themes, which can be superimposed spatially, is utilized.

This paper presents a framework to incorporate nonresident external trips within a travel demand model (TDM), whether it is a four-step model or an activity-based travel framework. This paper first describes the framework components for defining an external region and a series of interlinked models that are joined in a developed simulation platform to estimate external trips. Then, generation and distribution models for external-external (EE), external-internal (EI) and also nonresident non-home-based (NR-NHB) trips are described. The models also take into account the time-of-day (TOD) component for three essential motives: (1) to achieve more consistency in the origin-destination (OD) matrix of the external trips with the OD matrix of the internal trips for route assignment; (2) omitting the need to fit the TOD curves to disaggregate trips from 24-h trip tables into respective periods; and (3) providing an opportunity to better estimate NR-NHB trips which depend on the TOD because these trips are performed far from the home location and the number of such trips may decrease as the time progresses in a day, especially after midday. Furthermore, to minimize the need for any extra data collection, the models were developed using household travel survey data and opensource land-use data. The results suggest the suitability of the data sources to model external trips. Furthermore, the TOD-related variables, including its interaction effect with other explanatory variables, were found to be significant in many models, which signifies the importance of including a TOD component in modeling external trips. Model validation also confirmed the soundness of the proposed models. The paper, therefore, is beneficial for the practitioner community to estimate external trips and incorporate them in the travel demand model estimation.

The objective of this study is to quantify the value of satellite-based information in optimal inspection and maintenance strategies. To account for the uncertainties associated with satellite observations, the system was modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to determine optimal life-cycle inspection and maintenance policies.

Results indicate that satellite observations result in up to 6.5% reduction in cost if they are used to make maintenance and inspection decisions over the pavement life cycle.

While numerous modeling packages exist to simulate different wave-based modalities, the integrated sensor and media modeling environment is developed to, in a straightforward manner, physically represent the complex subsurface civil infrastructure environment. Physical modeling capabilities enable the object-oriented programming environment facility portability to other application domains as a generic volume serves as the boundaries for internal elements modeled to represent realistic changes in material properties and buried objects. Model development is demonstrated on a realistic bridge deck example.', 'kbelli@coe.neu.edu; swf@coe.neu.edu; rappaport@neu.edu', '0', '0', '2000-01-01 00:20:11', 25, 1);

The framework is totally independent of a specific application and of specific model definitions. The framework was created to provide a minimal design that is general, transparent, and extensible but that contains all the functionality that is required in FEA (comprehensive). Augmenting the framework for a specific application should require as little additional effort as possible. A key idea in the design of the framework is a strict, hierarchical organization of all information in FEA in four layers. The top layer is defined to capture all information and functionality that is valid for any component in FEA, the next to capture all that is valid for any specific type of component in FEA, e. g., element, the next for capturing all that is valid for components with specific geometrical requirements, e. g., linear, triangular element in two dimensions, and, finally, the last for capturing all that is required in a specific application, e. g., linear heat conduction with 1 degree of freedom per node. Layering of information and functionality in the four layers as described will greatly alleviate difficulties in the development of new components in FEA for use in new applications. New components may be extended from any appropriate level in the hierarchy, and all higher-level information and functionality can be utilized directly. Another key idea is the organization of information in separate models that may dynamically be edited and reevaluated. Even multiple models may be processed and evaluated in parallel. The framework is designed to provide a transparent basis for enhancing understanding and teaching the general concepts in FEA. It should enable researchers to develop new solution strategies and incorporate new solution algorithms within a minimal environment that is not burdened with the functionality required in modern, complex, commercial FEA products.

The first issue is that UAVs have a notoriously difficult time operating near bridges. This is because of the potential for the navigation signal to be lost between the operator and the UAV. Therefore, there is a push to automate or semiautomate the UAV inspection process. One way to improve automation is by improving UAVs\' ability to contextualize their environment through object detection and object avoidance. The second issue is that, to the best of the authors\' knowledge, no method has been developed to automatically contextualize detected defects to a structural bridge detail during or after UAV flight. Significant research has been conducted on UAVs\' ability to detect defects, like cracks and corrosion. However, detecting the presence of a defect alone does not contextualize its significance or help with an inspector\'s job to rate specific structural bridge details. This paper outlines a use case for a data set and model to detect critical structural bridge details, providing context and vision for enhancing the autonomous UAV bridge inspection process. Identifying these structural bridge details that require inspection may assist an UAV in path planning and object avoidance in GPS-denied environments. The detection of structural details adds an ability to contextualize defect detection and localize issues to a bridge detail. This also has implications for providing cues to inspectors, in real time, on defect-susceptible areas while UAVs are in flight. The image data set, Common Objects in Context for bridge inspection (COCO-Bridge), for UAV object detection was collected and then trained using deep learning techniques. This data set consists of 774 images and over 2,500 object instances to detect 4 structural bridge details: bearings, cover plate terminations, gusset plate connections, and out-of-plane stiffeners. These details were chosen because they either must be rated by an inspector or checked because they are prone to failure. Methods to economize the predictive capabilities of the model through image augmentation were investigated to extend the performance of the training images. It was concluded that for this domain of data, structural bridge detail images, the mean average precision, and F1 score performance were improved by mirroring the training images along their y-axis. The outcome of this paper was an open-source annotated data set, which can be used in computer vision applications for visual inspection, growing the capabilities of artificial intelligence in structural engineering.

Therefore, we set out to acquire bridge inspection data by selectively extracting candidate images from hundreds of thousands of bridge inspection reports from the Virginia Department of Transportation. Using this rich source of diverse data, we refined our collected data to develop four high-quality, easily extendable, publicly accessible datasets, tested with state-of-the-art models to support typical bridge inspection tasks. The four datasets: labeled cracks in the wild, 3,817 image sets of semantically segmented concrete cracks taken from diverse scenery; 3,817 image sets of semantically segmented structural inspection materials (concrete, steel, metal decking); 440 images of finely annotated steel corrosion condition state (good, fair, poor, severe); and 1,470 images of fatigue-prone structural steel bridge details (bearings, gusset plates, cover plate terminations, and out-of-plane stiffeners) for object detection. To ensure the extendibility of the datasets, the authors have proposed annotation guidelines to maintain consistent growth through annotation collaboration. Researchers can use these trained models and data for auxiliary inspection tasks such as damage detection, damage forecasting, automatic report generation, and, coupled with the assistance of unmanned aerial systems, for autonomous flight path planning and object avoidance.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanning is a new technology, which is beneficial because it collects the point clouds and the third dimension of the scanned objects. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have attracted researchers\' attention for concrete surface defect detection. However, no point cloud-based DL method currently is available for semantic segmentation of bridge surface defects without converting the data set into other representations, which results in increasing the size of the data set. Moreover, most of the current point cloud-based concrete surface defect detection methods focus on only one type of defect. On the other hand, a data set plays a key role in DL. Therefore, the lack of publicly available point cloud data sets for bridge surface defects is one of the reasons for the lack of studies in this area. To address these issues, this paper created a publicly available point cloud data set for concrete bridge surface defect detection, and developed a point cloud-based semantic segmentation DL method to detect different types of concrete surface defects. Surface Normal Enhanced PointNet++ (SNEPointNet++) was developed for semantic segmentation of concrete bridge surface defects (i.e., cracks and spalls). SNEPointNet++ focuses on two main characteristics related to surface defects (i.e., normal vector and depth) and considers the issues related to the data set (i.e., imbalanced data set). The data set, which was collected from four concrete bridges and classified into three classes (cracks, spalls, and no defect), is made available for other researchers. The model was trained and evaluated using 60% and 20% of the data set, respectively. Testing on the remaining part of the data set resulted in 93% and 92% recall for cracks and spalls, respectively. Spalls of the segments deeper than 7 cm (severe spalls) can be detected with 99% recall.', 'n_bolour@encs.concordia.ca; majid.nasrollahi@airmcosulting.com; f_bahrei@encs.concordia.ca; amin.hammad@concordia.ca', '2', '2', '2000-01-01 00:20:23', 37, 2);

The paper presents formal definitions of the semantics of these operators by using point set theory notation. It further describes two possible implementation methods: the first one is based on a discrete representation of the operands\' geometry by means of the hierarchical, space-partitioning data structure octree. The octree allows for the application of recursive algorithms that successively increase the discrete resolution of the spatial objects employed and thereby enables the user to trade off between computational effort and the required accuracy. By contrast, the second approach uses the exact boundary representation (B-Rep) of both spatial objects resulting in precise distance measurements. Here, the bounding facets of each operand are indexed by a so-called axis-aligned bounding boxes tree (AABB tree).

From a general training viewpoint, the system aims to address the shortcomings of existing construction trades training, in particular the lack of solutions for enabling trainees to train in realistic and challenging site conditions, while eliminating occupational health and safety risks. From a technical viewpoint, the system currently integrates state-of-the-art virtual reality goggles with a novel cost-effective 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head pose tracking system supporting the movement of trainees in room-size spaces, as well as a game engine to effectively manage the generation of the views of the virtual three-dimensional environment projected on the VR goggles.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-versus-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-versus-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-versus-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers.

Besides, the final PPC can be examined from a dynamic point of view for evaluating the compliance with the comfort and safety conditions. Moreover, to simplify the geometric representation and the calculation of the dynamic variables of the PPC, using computer software, a specific and innovative routine has been specifically developed by the writers.

However, they are not widely produced in most projects because a lot of effort is still necessary to manually convert remote sensing data from photogrammetry or laser scanning to an as-built model. In order to automate the generation of as-built models, the first and fundamental step is to automatically recognize infrastructure-related elements from the remote sensing data. This paper outlines a framework for creating visual pattern recognition models that can automate the recognition of infrastructure-related elements based on their visual features. The framework starts with identifying the visual characteristics of infrastructure element types and numerically representing them using image analysis tools. The derived representations, along with their relative topology, are then used to form element visual pattern recognition (VPR) models. So far, the VPR models of four infrastructure-related elements have been created using the framework. The high recognition performance of these models validates the effectiveness of the framework in recognizing infrastructure-related elements. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000104.

To find an optimal decomposition that minimizes error in the solution while maintaining a bound on the computational cost is challenging. In this work, existing multi-time-step methods are used and, for the first time, a systematic approach for traversing the space of possible decompositions to characterize the nature of how solution errors and computational costs vary for different decompositions is devised.

Results showed that the presence of a particulate media increased the average diameter and also increased the range of diameters of bubbles produced during sparging. As the diameter of the particulate media increased, the size of the bubbles decreased, indicating less coalescence in media with larger pore space. In addition, the effect of trace concentrations of surface-active agents (surfactants) on the diameter and coalescence behavior of bubbles was examined. In both aqueous and aqueous/particulate matrices, the presence of surfactants significantly decreased the average diameter of the bubbles produced.

While the goal of rehabilitation is typically to restore or improve the performance of the transportation system, the construction activity itself disrupts traffic and worsens the already-congested transportation network with unsafe work zones. Traffic simulation models are becoming widely used in evaluating such disruption in a controlled environment without physical implementation. Though rapid increase in computer processing power has made microscopic simulation feasible, developing valid models is still a tedious and time-consuming task that is prone to errors. This paper presents a study to automate development of microscopic traffic simulation models in a large-scale network by integrating the geographic information system (GIS) and microscopic traffic simulation. This study adopted an integration approach and developed a framework to combine GIS macro-and microscopic models. The developed framework was implemented in GIS to integrate a transportation GIS system (TransCAD) and microscopic traffic modeling system (transportation analysis simulation systems, TRANSIMS). GIS tools for data conversion and visualization were developed using geographic information system developer\'s kit (GISDK). The system was tested in the Southeast Michigan area to evaluate traffic impacts from the I-75/I-96 Ambassador Bridge Gateway Maintenance Project. The major contribution of this study from the practitioners\' perspective is the grouping of GIS tools that automate data conversion and processing, visualize model results, and compare simulation results with field observations in informational ways, thereby assisting in model development, calibration and validation, and results analysis. This study concluded that integration provided an efficient approach in developing valid microscopic traffic simulation models.

Most existing studies use either a vision-based or radio-based approach to automatically track construction entities, which, however, are bounded by the limitations of the applied technology. Vision-based tracking can achieve high localization accuracy but suffers from identity (ID) switch and fragmentation errors when multiple workers are in close proximity or occluded. In contrast, radio-based tracking is reliable in object detection and identification but less accurate in localization. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses results obtained from vision-based tracking and radio-based identification and localization for the 3D tracking of multiple construction workers. Compared to traditional fusion approaches that directly fuse locations extracted from these two approaches, the proposed method treats vision-based tracking as the main source to extract the object trajectory. Radio-based identification and localization results are used as a supplementary source to augment anonymous visual tracks with identity information and correct errors (e.g., false positives) in vision-based object detection, resulting in ID-linked 3D trajectories. In addition, a searching algorithm is introduced to recover possible missed detections in one camera view from the corresponding observations in the other view by applying a sliding window to search for regions with the most similar appearance along epipolar line. The newly created method has been validated using two indoor experiments. The results show that the new approach for fusing vision- and radio-based results increases the overall accuracy from 88% and 87% to 95% and 90%, compared to using a vision-based approach alone. The integration of radio-based identification is much more robust than using a vision system alone, as it allows the recovery of the same entity ID after the trajectory is fragmented and results in fewer fragmentations that last longer than 0.2 s.

Under the new era of human-robot coexistence and collaboration in dynamic and complex workspaces, it is critical for robots to navigate to the targets efficiently without colliding with moving workers. This study proposes a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based robot path planning method that integrates the predicted movements of construction workers to achieve safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in construction. First, an uncertainty-aware long short-term memory network is developed to predict the movements of construction workers and associated uncertainties. Second, a DRL framework is formulated, where predicted movements of construction workers are innovatively integrated into the state space and the computation of the reward function. By incorporating predicted trajectories in addition to current locations, the proposed method enables proactive planning such that the robot could better adapt to human movements, thus ensuring both safety and efficiency. The proposed method was demonstrated and evaluated using simulations generated based on real construction scenarios. The results show that prediction-based DRL path planning achieved a 100% success rate (with a total of 10,000 episodes) for robots to achieve the destination along the near-shortest path.

However, current spatial information regarding underground utilities is inconsistent, inaccurate, and uncertain, which is a root cause of numerous utility incidents. Information about underground utilities is usually provided by multiple sources, such as existing records and nondestructive testing technologies [e.g., ground-penetrating radar (GPR)]. A key challenge is the integration of imperfect data obtained from heterogeneous sources to create accurate underground utility maps. Aiming at accurately confirming the presence or absence of underground pipes, this study presents an information fusion method based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory to integrate both sensing and nonsensing data. The GPR and existing utility records serve as two independent information sources that provide evidence regarding the existence and configuration of buried utilities. The trust level of evidence provided by different sources is modeled as mass value, and practical guidance is proposed to quantitatively assign the mass value of individual data sources by considering various factors that affect the accuracy of each data source. By fusing the evidence from heterogeneous sources, the joint mass value is computed, based on which the state of pipes is inferred. Indoor experiments on three different scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed fusion approach leads to higher accuracy, precision, and recall in detecting pipes than using an individual data source. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed mass value selection guidance is validated through sensitivity analysis, namely the fusion result remains stable when the mass value for an individual data source varies slightly.

However, earthmoving operations are restricted to site work and surrounding terrain, and the presence of other structures, particularly in urban areas, limits the number of viewpoints from which operations can be recorded. These considerations lower the degree of intra-activity and interactivity category variability to which said algorithms are exposed, hindering their potential for generalizing effectively to new jobsites. Secondly, training computer vision algorithms is also typically reliant on large quantities of hand-annotated ground truth. These annotations are burdensome to obtain and can offset the cost-effectiveness incurred from automating activity analysis.

The authors introduce an automated synthetic data generation method that outputs a two-dimensional (2D) pose corresponding to simulated excavator operations that vary according to camera position with respect to the excavator and activity length and behavior. The presented method is validated by training a deep learning-based method on the synthesized 2D pose sequences and testing on pose sequences corresponding to real-world excavator operations, achieving 75% precision and 71% recall. This exceeds the 66% precision and 65% recall obtained when training and testing the deep learning-based method on the real-world data via cross-validation.

The system removes distortion by a robust estimation of a tunnel surface through structure from motion (SFM), which can create a 3D point cloud of the tunnel surface from uncalibrated images. SFM enables the mosaicing system to cope with images with a general camera motion, in contrast to standard mosaicing software that can cope only with a strict camera motion.

The parameter estimation problem is solved using a GA implementing selection, crossover, and mutation operators to obtain the global minimum solution.

This paper proposes a new criterion that provides adequate guidance on training termination without the necessity for a testing data set and illustrates the validity of the proposed criterion on three data sets for water resources and environmental engineering applications. An extensive study of a number of large and small data sets has indicated that the moving average of relative strength index of a randomly generated dummy input variable tends to reach zero at the optimal termination point and tends to move away from zero beyond the optimal point.

Despite the development of numerous building inspection robotic platforms, their motions still require manual control. To facilitate full automation, there is a need to explore autonomous navigation strategies for building inspection robots. Although different autonomous navigation strategies have been developed in the robotics field, few of them are suitable for building structural inspection behavior. In accordance with the responsibilities of professional inspectors, the robot is required to follow the structural components within a desired distance and dynamically avoid obstacles to conduct in-depth scanning. This navigation task becomes more difficult when providing a smooth following path in special building scenarios, such as narrow corners. Motivated by this need, the present study aimed to explore autonomous navigation for building inspection robots. To save the cost of map construction, local navigation strategies, which control the robots\' travel in unknown environments, were targeted. Specifically, the objective is to develop a robust fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for wall-following behavior. The inputs are the distances within the designed interval ranges, which were measured with a 360 degrees laser. The membership functions and the decision-making rules were designed based on robot and camera configurations, building designs, and structural inspection criteria. The outputs are the real-time angular and linear velocities. Tested in both simulation and real-world environments, the proposed FLC is able to (1) find the wall, follow the wall, conduct self-turning, and avoid obstacles in unknown building scenarios, (2) prevent wavy motions, and (3) prevent path deviations for arbitrary surfaces.

On the other hand, real-time traffic data acquisition has been the core and basis of all development of advanced traffic-management systems. For the goal of measuring reliable traffic speed, the traffic data sources should generally include spot speed data received from vehicle detectors, space speed data collected by probe vehicles, and historical data to generate traffic information for main arterials within urban areas. This paper describes the fusion technique to integrate active and passive data from spot and space data for the estimation of traffic speed in emergency scenarios based on entropy and optimal weight. This provides road-network information to decision makers in emergency response. Through the proposed fusion process, the collection, fusion, and analysis of traffic speed data are performed. The process is composed of three consecutive computational steps. The first step is data screening to reduce inaccuracy of outliers in the system. The second step is to transform data into the same basis of space mean speed, and to classify and individualize the data. Data can then be converted into probabilities for the production of entropy.

The proposed framework was tested with several large-volume data sets collected in diverse scene types using several data acquisition platforms including terrestrial lidar, mobile lidar, airborne lidar, and drone-based SfM-MVS photogrammetry. In evaluating the accuracy of models generated from Vo-Norvana against manual segmentation, the average error of the position, orientation, and dimensions are 2.7 mm, 0.083 degrees, and 0.9 mm, respectively. Over 0.2 million points per second and 36 thousand voxels per second can be achieved when segmenting an airborne lidar data set containing over 639 million points to about 1 million segments.', 'Erzhuo.Che@oregonstate.edu; Michael.Olsen@oregonstate.edu', '0', '0', '2000-01-01 00:20:23', 37, 4);

Efficient distribution of resources, such as heavy construction equipment, is critical to urban search and rescue operations.

These challenges are obstacles to efficient search-and-rescue operations. This paper presents an innovative approach that facilitates immediate equipment distribution in response to disasters. The equipment control structure, inspired by the behavior control structure of honeybees\' foraging, enables decentralized and collective decision-making for equipment prioritization and distribution. With the equipment control structure applied to facilities management such as construction equipment distribution, disaster-response operations have the potential to become more efficient. With the preliminary findings from computer simulation runs of the equipment control structure in a controlled environment, decision makers could evaluate policies for equipment distribution in a decentralized disaster response.

On the other hand, huge and complex models can increase the time for model transfer, increase the computation workload while rendering, and reduce fluency when using AR/VR applications. Therefore, this paper aims to develop efficient mechanisms for BIM-to-AR/VR data transfer to better utilize the information of BIM.

This research then integrates the EFNIM with an object-oriented computer technique to develop an EFNIS.

Here, post processed trajectory information from UWB signals populate an occupancy grid, which is a spatial histogram of workers, travel patterns. The occupancy grid is used for path planning and serves two purposes. The first suggests optimal paths for workers while the second generates optimal paths for vehicles. The path generation algorithm provides multiple paths, and optimality scores for a variety of path metrics, including distance, time, and worker sparsity. To generate the optimal paths, a path planning graph is generated from the occupancy grid and any automatically determined or manually specified obstacles. The algorithm applies equally to any mobile, major construction resource: workers, equipment, and materials that are tagged with a UWB tag.

The developed method uses sensors to collect two data types, as follows: (1) a laser scanner measures the as-built conditions and geometry of a construction site, and (2) real-time location-tracking technology gathers the mostly dynamic location of workers on the ground. Several algorithms are presented to (1) identify blind spaces from the collected point cloud data that limit the visibility of a crane operator, (2) process real-time location-tracking data of workers on the ground, and (3) fuse the resulting data to create information that allows a quantitative assessment of the situational awareness of a tower crane operator. Results to a field trial are presented and show that a tower crane operator using the developed approach can increase understanding of where and when occluded spaces and ground-level operations occur.

The criticality of documents exchanged or referred to by various parties, evolves over the course of the project life cycle. Determining the criticality of documents at different stages of the project can aid companies with managing the flow of information in an organized manner, while providing for the detection of potentially disruptive, erroneous material that could result in delays and costs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine documents that have the potential to disrupt a process, so that they may be prevented from entering or interfering with the active flow of information in a project. Electronic product and process management (EPPM) systems provide the capability to establish and map information flow between different parties in a construction project. Analyzing an EPPM system may yield information about the criticality of certain documents within an activity, as well as isolate characteristics peculiar to documents, which can assist in risk mitigation. A methodology is proposed to identify such critical documents. Four factors were identified based upon metadata, structure, and historical data recorded for documents within an EPPM system to determine the criticality of documents over a construction project life cycle. The factors and a combined score were calculated for a model project scenario-based simulation within a full-scale EPPM system and anticipated problematic documents were identified. It was therefore functionally demonstrated that determining critical construction documents via document metadata and access history records is feasible and may contribute to both industry and the academic body of knowledge for document classification.

Quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art parallel strategies in terms of factorization were carried out, leading to the problem-optimized solver, which successfully embraces the penalty method and banded nature. Particularly, the penalty method employed imparts considerable smoothness to the global response, which yields practical superiority of the parallel triangular system solution over those of advanced solvers such as the parallel preconditioned conjugate gradient method.

This study combines regression analysis techniques with a cluster analysis by using a large quantity of real-world data obtained from the pavement management information system. The clustering analysis revealed that traffic loading would be the most crucial affecting factor for pavement performance. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effect of individual critical performance-driven factors on FMC. A prediction error analysis validated the model\'s robustness, proving that reliable FMC can be estimated by analyzing how it interacts with the affecting factors.

Modeling the dynamics of HPC, which is a highly complex composite material, is extremely challenging. Concrete compressive strength is also a highly nonlinear function of ingredients. Several studies have independently shown that concrete strength is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio but also by additive materials. The compressive strength of HPC is a function of all concrete content, including cement, fly ash, blast-furnace slag, water, superplasticizer, age, and coarse and fine aggregate. The quantitative analyses in this study were performed by using five different data-mining methods: two machine learning models (artificial neural networks and support vector machines), one statistical model (multiple regression), and two metaclassifier models (multiple additive regression trees and bagging regression trees). The methods were developed and tested against a data set derived from 17 concrete strength test laboratories.

However, little research has been done to characterize the nature and extent of the potential impact of the occupant on energy consumption. Energy models typically assume deterministic loads and schedules to represent occupancy and provide singular estimates of energy consumption. This paper investigates uncertainties introduced by occupant behavior by exploring the impacts of high and low comparisons on the energy performance of buildings through parametric simulation of commercial and residential buildings in two climates. The results suggest that variant occupant behavior can impact annual energy usage on the order of magnitude of 75% in residential buildings (peak load varying by 65%) and 150% for commercial buildings (peak load varying by 140%), with modest variations across climates. Although further and more sophisticated experiments are necessary, the contributions of this paper include a simple process model for assessing, through simulation, the role of the occupant on energy consumption and demonstration data about the type and magnitude of impacts that occupants can have in residential and commercial buildings across climates.', 'caroline.clevenger@colostate.edu', '41', '46', '2000-01-01 00:20:14', 28, 1);

In uncertainty quantification, statistics such as mean and variance of the response of these physical systems are sought. To estimate these statistics, sampling-based methods like Monte Carlo often require many evaluations of the models\' governing differential equations for multiple realizations of the uncertainty. However, for large complex engineering systems, these methods become computationally burdensome as the solution of the models\' governing differential equations for such systems is expensive. In structural engineering, an otherwise linear structure often contains spatially local nonlinearities with uncertainty present in them. A standard nonlinear solver for them with sampling-based methods for uncertainty quantification incurs significant computational cost for estimating the statistics of the response. To ease this computational burden of uncertainty quantification of large-scale locally nonlinear dynamical systems, a method is proposed herein that decomposes the response into two parts: response of a deterministic nominal linear system and a corrective term. This corrective term is the response from a pseudoforce that contains the nonlinearity and uncertainty information. In this paper, neural network, a recently popular tool for universal function approximation in the scientific machine-learning community due to the advancement of computational capability as well as the availability of open-source packages, is used to estimate the pseudoforce. Since only the nonlinear and uncertain pseudoforce is modeled using the neural networks, the same network can be used to predict a different response of the system, and no new network is required to train if the statistics of a different response are sought.

This is especially correct given the increasing complexity of building product models and the emergence of building information models with project documents linked to them. In addition, engineers usually have distinct information needs. Research shows that engineers working with building information models place particular importance on the understanding of retrieved content before using it or applying it and that exploration of context is essential for this understanding. Both these factors (the nature of engineering content and the information needs of engineers) make general information retrieval techniques for computing relevance and visualizing search results less applicable in civil engineering information retrieval systems. This paper argues that granularity is a fundamental concept that needs to be considered when measuring relevance and visualizing search results in information retrieval systems for repositories of building design and construction content. It is hypothesized that the design of systems with careful regard for granularity would improve engineers\' relevance judgment behavior. To test this hypothesis, a prototype system, called CoMem-XML, was developed and evaluated in terms of the time needed for users to find relevant information, the accuracy of their relevance judgment, and their subjective satisfaction with the prototype. A user study was conducted in which test subjects were asked to complete tasks by using various forms of the prototype, to complete a satisfaction questionnaire, and to be interviewed. The findings show that users perform better and are more satisfied when the search result interface of the CoMem-XML system presents only relevant information in context. On the other hand, interfaces that present the retrieved information out of context (i.e., without highlighting its position in the parts hierarchy) are less effective for participants to judge relevance.

In the proposed algorithm, the original structure is partitioned into a number of subdomains. Each subdomain is solved independently and, therefore, concurrently using a traditional direct-solution method. Finally, the solution for the interface degrees of freedom between neighboring subdomains is obtained by enforcing compatibility and equilibrium using an iterative procedure. The nonlinear version of the algorithm involves two iterations: The nonlinear dynamic equilibrium iteration and the interface equilibrium and compatibility iteration. The integration of these two iterations is investigated and two strategies are developed. It is found that the strategy in which the two iterations are isolated is the most efficient.

The authors\' prior research on this inherently decentralized technique demonstrated that substructure identification can detect and localize stiffness changes in a shear building. However, identification performance varies from story to story, with parameters of a few stories not satisfactorily identified. To overcome this limitation, the authors and colleagues showed that a structural control device can be used to temporarily change the dynamics of the structure to improve identification performance; however, prior studies assumed full-state feedback, which is not achievable in full-scale implementations. This paper investigates structural control using limited sensor measurements to improve substructure identification. The substructure method is first summarized, followed by an error analysis that can predict a priori the level of error in story parameter estimates. Then, a novel controlled substructure identification procedure is introduced with constraints to ensure that the controlled responses improve substructure identification while reducing overall structural response. State feedback is utilized, with a Kalman filter to estimate states using various sets of acceleration sensor measurements to understand the performance trade-offs. The implementation methodology using an object-oriented programing paradigm is explained; a 3.66-m (12-ft) four-story single-bay steel structure model, subject to low levels of ground motion, is the test bed used for numerical simulations to demonstrate the proposed methodology.

Particle swarm optimization is inspired by the social behavior of flocks (swarms) of birds and insects (particles). Every particle\'s position represents a specific design.

These particles are attracted toward the positions of both their personal best solution and the best solution of the swarm in a stochastic manner.

Incorporating the reliability into the structural optimization framework one can seek a reliability-based optimal design.

Identifying the relationship between shield parameters and the resulting settlement is of vital importance to the reasonable adjustment of the shield parameters so as to control settlement development. However, many other factors, besides the shield parameters, affect settlement, which makes shield-ground interaction complicated. Therefore, a better method is necessary for extracting the shield-ground relationship for the purpose of steering shield tunneling. This paper proposes a method that incorporates smooth relevance vector machine (sRVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for shield steering with concern for settlement control. First, smooth relevance vector machine with adaptive Gaussian kernel function is used to establish the relationship between the identified factors and the settlement. Particle swarm optimization is then applied to identify the appropriate kernel parameters. Then, optimal shield parameters are searched based on the established relationships. A slurry shield-driven tunnel (the Jiyuqiao-Jianghan Road tunnel) is used to validate the method. The results evaluate the potential as well as some limitations of the proposed method, which attempts to offer an alternative means for feedforward control of shield steering.

The results indicate that BIM projects have more direct connections and shorter paths among the nodes, making the interpersonal information exchange easier and faster. In addition, it was found that the higher clustering coefficients and simultaneously lower path lengths of the networks in BIM projects result in a strong small worldness, where most nodes are not neighbors, but can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops.

As a result, good practices such as the avoidance of U-turns cannot be used. This study introduces geographic information system (GIS)-integrated software (RouteSW) for the optimization of MSW collection routes by considering path constraints. The software uses a parallelized hybrid genetic algorithm (PHGA) to obtain the optimal routes. The accuracy of the optimization algorithm is verified based on four asymmetric traveling salesman benchmark problems. Then, RouteSW is applied to generate the MSW collection routes in the Bahcelievler and Emek districts of Ankara (Turkey) for two different optimization models; Model A and Model B. Model A minimizes the total length of the collection route. Model B additionally takes road inclinations and collection truckloads into account in minimizing the total length traveled. Results indicate that although Model B produces longer paths compared with Model A, it prevents waste collection uphill when the collection truck is loaded. For both models, U-turns are avoided as aimed. Routes are displayed in a three-dimensional (3D) terrain view for each MSW collection truck. Service orders of MSW collection points are indicated in the display as well for each collection truck.

This paper presents a comprehensive geospatial approach based on the fuzzy classification and regression tree (FCART) to predict motor vehicle crashes and their severity on two-lane, two-way roads. The combined use of fuzzy and decision tree in FCART model solves the uncertainty associated with input data; the model can be easily understood and interpreted because of its graphical tree structure. The FCART model uses fuzzy logic to resolve the difficulty of analyzing input variables where no definitive boundary exists between the categories. Moreover, a bagging algorithm is applied in the FCART model to deal with high-variance crash data and improve the performance of the learning process. The bagged-FCART algorithm is tested against FCART, the classification and regression tree (CART), and the support vector machine (SVM) as inferential engines to predict crash severity and uncover spatial and nonspatial factors that systematically relate to crash severity. The results show that applying the bagging algorithm in the FCART model considerably improves the prediction accuracy and that the bagged-FCART model is superior to other tested models in predicting crash severity. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the importance of input factors. Parts of the results obtained from this analysis are consistent with the existing traffic safety literature and demonstrate that vehicle failure, drivers wearing seat belts, and weather condition factors are some of the most important factors contributing to crash severity. The proposed approach illustrates that in addition to these factors, geographical factors such as proximity to curves and adjacent facilities and land use have a significant effect on crash severity. These results support the prioritization of effective safety measures that are geographically targeted and behaviorally sound on two-lane, two-way roads.

Previous studies attempted to explain the relation between architectural design features (e.g., the existence of daylight and connectivity to nature) and human experience. However, the extent of how different design features influence human experience has not been fully quantified yet. This study provides an integrated method that fuses virtual reality and noninvasive body area sensor networks (BSNs) to quantify human experience in architectural spaces. Using a set of biometric sensors, several physiological metrics such as skin conductance, brain activity, and heart rate were captured and examined while subjects were navigating and performing tasks in virtual environments (VEs). The integrated platform has been used to quantify the sense of stress and anxiety through structured user experiments in a visualization laboratory using alternate VEs configured by varying the related set of architectural design features. To generalize the findings of this study, a large pool of participants was invited to the experiments, where statistically significantly different results could be obtained.

The results show the need of considering spatial models for taxi demand and demonstrate significant improvement in the prediction of demand using the two proposed models.

Such partitioning approaches, however, rely on strong and occasional unwarranted assumptions regarding the interactions among different engineering components. Fluid and structure interaction, soil and structure interaction, and human and structure interaction are but a few of the many such partitioned analyses commonly needed in civil engineering applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining the expertise developed separately in traditionally distinct fields to obtain a holistic treatment of engineering problems. Such holistic treatment would ultimately yield not only more realistic and accurate analyses of coupled systems but also improved optimality in engineering designs. This growing interest has resulted in development of mathematical coupling procedures for conjoining multiple, separately developed, single-solver numerical models along their interfaces. The present manuscript contributes to the field of partitioned analysis by introducing a novel mathematical coupling procedure based on the minimization of an objective function consisting of coupling conditions. The authors\' approach to coupling implements optimization techniques and is observed to eliminate the divergence issues that may be encountered with iterative coupling methods. The proposed optimization-based coupling scheme is compared against the well-known block Gauss-Seidel (BGS) iteration method and considers two aspects: the accuracy of the coupled model predictions and the convergence of the coupled parameters. The comparison is completed for three case studies with increasing complexity: a linear set of equations, polynomials with random coefficients, and a linear dynamic system.

In this paper, a self-adaptive fitness formulation is presented for solving constrained optimization of water distribution networks. The method has been formulated to ensure that slightly infeasible solutions with a low objective function value remain fit. This is seen as a benefit in solving highly constrained problems that have solutions on one or more of the constraint bounds. In contrast, solutions well outside the constraint bounds are seen as containing little genetic information that is of use and are therefore penalized. In this method, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced by representing the constraint violations by a single infeasibility measure. The infeasibility measure is used to form a two-stage penalty that is applied to infeasible solutions. The performance of the method has been examined by its application to two water distribution networks from literature. The results have been compared with previously published results. It is shown that the method is able to find optimum solutions with less computational effort. The proposed method is easy to implement, requires no parameter tuning, and can be used as a fitness evaluator with any evolutionary algorithm.

This leads to higher uncertainties in the location of 3D points, and may result in the failure of the whole reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel procedure to address this problem. It hypothesizes that a set of multiple calibration parameters created by videotaping a moving calibration pattern along a specific path can increase overall calibration accuracy and ultimately enhance the Euclidean accuracy of the generated point cloud. This is achieved by using conventional camera calibration algorithms to perform separate estimations for certain predefined distance values.

Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects.

As a consequence, nearly all design codes provide equations for the evaluation of the concrete shear strength, mostly derived empirically from experimental data. In this regard, some recent studies have shown that code provisions in force might be unfit to capture adequately many trends and can become unsafe for practical applications. In light of the existing difficulties and uncertainties, the implementation of proper computational methods-together with the use of recent and qualified database of experimental data-is essential to carry out reliable formulations. In this paper, a new hybrid computational technique dubbed evolutionary polynomial regression is adopted to estimate the concrete shear strength for rectangular RC beams. It combines a genetic algorithm and the least squares regression in a way that considers complexity and fidelity to experimental data as conflicting criteria. A set of nondominated capacity models is first determined using a large experimental database. The capacity equation that provides the best compromise between accuracy and complexity is further elaborated in a statistical fashion to allow its potential use in building codes.

To control the enormous computational effort that the analysis of large-scale systems requires, researchers and engineers have often resorted to considerably simplifying the behavior of such systems. The drawback of the current approach is that extremely simplified models might not adequately predict the response of structures. Given the availability of more powerful computers at increasingly cheaper cost, it is now possible to create accurate models for large-scale systems and contain the computational requirements. As a consequence, probabilistic analyses of complex nonlinear models have now become possible. This paper describes a parametric object-oriented parallel message passing interface (MPI) framework for the structural reliability analysis of bridges for the effect of overweight traffic load. The framework consists of three modules that characterize bridge member capacities, develop bridge structural system models, and perform the reliability analysis using an efficient Monte Carlo strategy. The results of the analysis show that the hybrid approach considerably reduces the number of simulations when compared to a crude Monte Carlo simulation, running a full system reliability analysis in just few seconds and preserving good accuracy on the reliability index, on the order of 4-14%.

Earlier work has shown that CGM can provide reasonably accurate simulations at a processing speed several orders of magnitude faster than FDM or FEM. This note describes and demonstrates refinements to the CGM approach that increase its modeling accuracy to a level comparable to FEM, while doubling its processing speed. These refinements are: (1) the use of a hybrid linear regression model with an artificial neural network (ANN) to represent each coarse-grain modeling element (the hybridization of the ANN effectively halves its complexity); and (2) a linear calibration of the ANN-based coarse-grain modeling elements to account for an observed positive bias in their predictions.

The thermal behavior of each coarse-grain element is captured using empirical modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs).

However, they do not account for the dynamic internal and external building changes that occur with time. Furthermore, these tools adopt a discrete approach by ignoring the trade-offs among the pillars of sustainability. Hence, sustainability assessment should progress toward defining the building\'s performance against achievable or predefined sustainability targets. This process, commonly known as benchmarking, has found limited applications in the building sector due to the lack of standard methods and internationally comparable data inventory. The systems thinking approach is ideal for handling these challenges associated with building sustainability evaluation and benchmarking owing to its potential to handle different subcomponents and their dynamic interdependencies. Further, benchmarking requires large data sets and involves significant testing and experimenting with numerous scenarios. Hence, a viable solution is to model and simulate the building\'s sustainability while integrating various scenario interventions to define standard benchmarks. Therefore, this study proposes a novel sustainability assessment and benchmarking (SAB) framework for the building sector using system dynamics (a branch of systems thinking) modeling and simulation approach along with multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods. The SAB framework is demonstrated using the case of the affordable housing segment in India, for which a sustainability benchmarking scale is developed. The main findings of the case study show that renewable energy interventions above 80% are an efficient way to improve a building\'s sustainability to the best performance levels. Additionally, the net-zero energy policy is not the only way to reach the highest level of sustainability because a combination of material, water, and energy interventions could also lead to improved sustainability performance.

In recent years, several researchers have used illustrative case studies to demonstrate how adopting BIM for specific uses can improve project performance. However, generalizable findings that may be extended across the industry remain somewhat elusive. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study to examine the impact of BIM use adoption and BIM Execution Planning (BEP) on project performance across a range of project delivery methods. The core research questions guiding the study were (1) does increased BIM use adoption improve project performance, as measured by cost, schedule, and quality metrics? and (2) what role does BEP have in the successful implementation of BIM on a project? By leveraging data from over 200 projects, these questions were answered via a multiple regression analysis. The results showed a significant positive relationship between BIM use adoption and the speed of delivery, perceived facility quality, and group cohesion within the project team, when controlling for project complexity. There was no evidence to suggest that the level of participation in BEP by members of the project team moderated those relationships. Instead, BEP participation was a significant predictor of BIM use adoption. Projects implementing BEP with either a designer-contractor team or the full project team were associated with increased BIM use adoption compared with projects that did not implement BEP. Despite these key findings, this study revealed a need for a new approach for capturing process data across projects to enable more-detailed future analysis. Prior research, including the data set used in this study, was designed to test macrolevel relationships, and omits many of the details about the specific processes or implementation aspects that drive day-to-day actions.

Data synthesis is gaining attention as an alternative to increase the volume of classified data. At the same time, the amount of Building Information Models (BIMs) provided by manufacturers on website databases is increasing. In line with these recent trends, this paper presents a deep-learning framework for classifying point cloud objects based on synthetic data sets created from BIM objects. The method starts by transforming BIM objects into point clouds deriving a data set consisting of 21 object classes characterized with various perturbation patterns. Then, the data set is split into four subsets to carry out the evaluation of synthetic data on the implemented flexible two-dimensional (2D) deep neural framework. In the latter, binary or greyscale images can be generated from point clouds by both orthographic or perspective projection to feed the network. Moreover, the surface variation feature was computed in order to aggregate more geometric information to images and to evaluate how it influences the object classification. The overall accuracy is over 85% in all tests when orthographic images are used. Also, the use of greyscale images representing surface variation improves performance in almost all tests although the computation of this feature may not be robust in point clouds with complex geometry or perturbations.

There are two types of cracking models available in the literature. The first type of model is structured to predict time to failure (given a specific failure criterion, e.g., 25% of the total area shows cracking). The other type of model is intended to directly predict the cracking area as a function of a set of covariates. For the first type of model, previous researchers have suggested a probabilistic approach such as survival modeling (or duration modeling) to take various uncertainties into consideration. However, to the authors\' knowledge, no current study considers the effect of heterogeneity when applying survival models to pavement fatigue cracking. In the context of deterioration modeling, heterogeneity can be defined as the performance difference across different individuals. Ignoring unobserved heterogeneity may lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.

It is important to maintain accurate and up-to-date information stored in a BIM so that it can become a reliable data source throughout the service life of a facility. Laser scanning technology is able to capture accurate geometric data in the form of a point cloud and to depict the existing condition of a building. Hence, point cloud data captured by laser scans can be used as references to update a given BIM. An important step during the update process is to match segments of elements captured by a point cloud to building components modeled in a BIM, so that the discrepancies between the two data sets can be identified. Typically, features depicted within point cloud segments and BIM components are used in the matching process. However, understanding is limited regarding which features enable the matching process and how these features perform. This paper describes six feature-based matching approaches that match segments of a point cloud to components modeled in a BIM.

To overcome the shortcomings of ant colony optimization, using the principle of searching an entire road by forward and reverse searches of ants, a new algorithm, meeting ant colony optimization, is proposed. Then, combined with typical mature limit equilibrium analysis (Spencer method), meeting ant colony optimization is used to locate the critical slip surface of a slope. Through two typical examples the effectiveness of the new algorithm is verified. The results show that for both the entire search scope and the search scope from one point, the meeting ant colony optimization performs better than ant colony optimization, which shows that in searching for the critical slip surface of a slope, meeting ant colony optimization provides better solution diversity.

One of the most important elements when designing a highway is the sight distance available to road users. Designing safe highways involves ensuring that this distance exceeds the minimum distance required by drivers negotiating different segments of a highway. If the sight distance available is less than that required, the likelihood of a driver safely completing a certain maneuver decreases. Measuring the available sight distance along a highway and ensuring that minimum design standards are met often requires field visits or graphic analysis of as-built drawings. Although these techniques are effective, they require significant time and effort. As a means of reducing the burden associated with sight distance assessment and in an attempt to help proactively address sight distance limitations on roads, this paper proposes an process by which sight distance along a highway can be automatically assessed on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data collected on test highways. The data was first used to create a digital surface model; observer and target points are then defined along the highway\'s travel lanes. After that, the line of sight assessment is conducted to determine the existence of obstructions between the pairs of observer and target points. An algorithm to calculate the available sight distance based on the outputs of the Line of Sight assessment is then developed. The algorithm was tested on two different highway segments in Alberta, Canada, and was successful in determining the available sight distance in both cases. The extracted information was then compared to theoretical sight distance values, and it was found that the minimum stopping sight distance (SSD) was met in all but a small region of one of the segments. Moreover, a passing sight distance (PSD) assessment also revealed that minimum requirements were not met at one of the passing zones in one of the segments. Finally, collision records for locations where sight distance was limited were examined, and it was found that sight distance limitation could have been a factor in collision occurrence.', 'gargoum@ualberta.ca; basyouny@ualberta.ca; sabbagh@ualberta.ca', '40', '40', '2000-01-01 00:20:18', 32, 4);

However, traffic flow patterns in evacuation contexts is far more complex than normal traffic and is usually accompanied with severe congestion due to the presence of evacuees. In such scenarios, agent-based simulation can accurately capture evacuation traffic patterns, which can be extremely useful in evacuation management. However, existing simulators are not fully capable of simultaneously handling highly detailed household behaviors as well as large-scale traffic in evacuation contexts. In this study, we develop a parallelizable, large-scale version of A-RESCUE (an agent-based regional evacuation simulator coupled with user-enriched behavior) called A-RESCUE 2.0. Detailed household evacuation behaviors are modeled using a comprehensive decision-making module. Computation loads induced by the large number of evacuation vehicles are distributed by a parallelization scheme that involves partitioning the road network into subnetworks such that traffic updates in each subnetwork are simultaneously updated in parallel. Dynamic load balancing among different subnetworks is ensured by periodically repartitioning the network using a mutilevel graph partitioning algorithm. A predictive network-weighing scheme is developed that assigns weights (reflecting computational load) to the roads of a network based on current and predicted future network traffic loadings. An on-demand routing strategy is also developed that allows effective rerouting computation based on changing traffic patterns. A-RESCUE 2.0 is capable of representing nonevacuee background traffic, as well as uncertain events on the network like road closures. In addition, real-time monitoring of traffic patterns is made possible using a visualization module that is connected to the simulator through an efficient data communication layer.

Results show that the reinforcement learning controllers increases red and yellow times but ultimately achieve superior performance compared to the Webster\'s controller, reducing mean queues, stopped time, and travel time.

The committee aims to understand and measure the evolution of computing in civil engineering, architecture, and construction management curricula and evaluate the current state of computing within the AEC curricula. The paper contains an investigation of the levels and concentrations of computer-science knowledge versus computer skills in curricula. In addition, the committee seeks to recognize the similarities and differences between architecture, engineering, and construction management programs by comparing the data associated with these disciplines. The paper also includes a discussion of basic aspects of computing education including the prerequisites that are necessary for further learning. The survey results provide useful benchmarks for decision making regarding research, industry collaboration, and curricula. Findings of the study include: (1) the importance and coverage of computer skills and competence of graduates has increased over the past decade; (2) computing skills are judged to be more important than computer-science knowledge in AEC curricula; (3) the links between computer-science concepts and AEC applications of computing are not yet fully recognized; (4) computing education is not sufficient to meet the demands of the AEC industry and the share of computing courses is less than what educators desire; and (5) scientific concepts of computing are important for preparing architects and engineers for unknown future developments in information technology.

Under the framework, the visible damage (cracks and spalling) inflicted on RC members (columns) is detected using machine vision. The damage properties are then measured in relationship to the column\'s dimensions and orientation, so that the existing state of the column can be approximated as a damage index. The column damage index is then used to query fragility curves of similar buildings, constructed from the analyses of existing and ongoing experimental data. The framework is expected to automate the collection of building damage data, to provide a quantitative assessment of the building damage state, and to estimate the vulnerability of the building in the event of an aftershock.

But sequential additions of separate solutions rarely lead to an optimal design. For example, the basic structural system is often developed with its geometry and topology but without consideration of important aspects of structural performance, like robustness, redundancy, ductility. Decisions on performance are left for later design stages, when it is still possible to change details but too late to improve the structural system. A design that takes into account multiple objectives, such as safety, functionality, and aesthetics, requires a complete reconsideration of the authors\' conventional sequential structural design process. Most engineering tools were developed many years ago as technology was much more limited, resulting in separate tools for separate objectives to be used in succession. In this paper, a new approach is presented as integrative structural design (ISD), where separate state-of-the-art solutions are synchronized in such a way that designers are not confined to predetermined solution paths but rather are enabled to consider different objectives concurrently including interactions between objectives. The resulting design tool for the conceptual, interactive modeling, simulation, and visualization of structural design or integrative design is presented under the term integrative structural design system (ISDS).

The input module accepts thematic images of contributing factors for landslides. The understanding module interprets input images to extract relevant information as required by the expert module.

However, the perceived high initial cost of implementing BIM has deterred many industry professionals from adopting this technology. This paper aims to facilitate the decision-making process in the adoption of BIM by presenting the cost savings associated with implementing BIM. In many cases, an owner\'s willingness to pay for the BIM is crucial in the contractor\'s decision to use BIM. Therefore, in order to show the returns on the investment (ROI) of paying additional fees, data was gathered from three case studies on three sets of similar projects, with each set consisting of one recently constructed BIM-assisted project and one earlier, similar project completed without BIM. The potential savings to an owner choosing to invest in BIM as an additional service were estimated based on the measurable cost benefits associated with reduced schedule overruns, fewer requests for information (RFIs), and reduced change orders. This research confirmed that BIM is a worthwhile investment in the context of the company studied. In the three case studies presented, the ROI of BIM varied greatly from 16 to 1,654%. Additionally, the total number of RFIs was reduced by 34% on a small tilt-wall project, 68% on a three-story assisted living facility, and 43% on a midrise commercial condominium project, and the number of change orders was reduced by 40, 48, and 37%, respectively. Though an owner\'s decision to invest in BIM should be weighed against the scale and complexity of a project, this research suggests that savings may be realized regardless of the size of a construction project. The paper presents a systematic approach for estimating the ROI realized in adopting BIM using standard project documentation. Finally, general suggestions for documenting BIM-assisted construction projects are outlined based on limitations uncovered during this study.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new algorithm for semantic segmentation and recognition of highway assets using video frames collected from a car-mounted camera. The proposed set of algorithms (1) takes the captured frames and using a pipeline of structure from motion and multiview stereo reconstructs a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud model of the highway and surrounding assets; (2) using a Semantic Texton Forest classifier, each geo-registered two-dimensional (2D) video frame at the pixel-level is segmented based on shape, texture, and color of the highway assets; and finally, (3) based on the results of the 2D segmentation and a new voting scheme, each reconstructed 3D point in the cloud is also categorized for one type of asset and is color coded accordingly. The resulting augmented reality environment that integrates the color-coded point clouds with the geo-registered video frames enables a user to conduct visual walk through and query different categories of assets. Experiments were performed on a challenging video data set containing sequences filmed from a moving car on a 2.2-mi-long, two-lane highway research facility.

The current practice of building diagnostics typically involves nonintrusive data collection using thermal cameras. This requires large amounts of unordered and nongeo-tagged two-dimensional (2D) imagery to be manually analyzed at a later stage, which makes the analysis time-consuming and labor-intensive. Because of the absence of a benchmark for energy performance, identification of performance problems also heavily relies on the auditor\'s knowledge, and consequently may lead to subjective and error-prone inspections. As a step towards rapid and objective identification of performance problems, this paper presents a new method for automated analysis and visualization of deviations between buildings\' actual and simulated energy performances. The proposed method is based on the recently developed energy performance augmented reality (EPAR) environments. In the EPAR modeling method, actual and expected three-dimensional (3D) spatio-thermal models are generated and superimposed in a common 3D virtual environment. The method leverages unordered collections of thermal and digital imagery for actual energy performance modeling, in addition to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for expected energy performance simulation. Based on the EPAR models which store actual and simulated thermal values at the level of 3D points, two new algorithms are developed to facilitate identification of potential performance problems: (1)3D thermal mesh modeling using k-d trees and nearest-neighbor searching to automate calculation of temperature deviations, and (2)automated visualization of performance deviations using a metaphor based on traffic light colors. The proposed modeling method is validated on several interior locations of instructional and residential buildings. Empirical observations show that automated analysis using EPAR models enables performance deviations to be rapidly and accurately measured.

Such information directly supports control decision-making and if automated, can significantly impact management of a project. This paper presents a new automated approach for recognition of physical progress based on two emerging sources of information: (1) unordered daily construction photo collections, which are currently collected at almost no cost on all construction sites; and (2) building information models (BIMs), which are increasingly turning into binding components of architecture/engineering/construction contracts. First, given a set of unordered and uncalibrated site photographs, an approach based on structure-from-motion, multiview stereo, and voxel coloring and labeling algorithms is presented that calibrates cameras, photorealistically reconstructs a dense as-built point cloud model in four dimensions (three dimensions + time), and traverses and labels the scene for occupancy. This strategy explicitly accounts for occlusions and allows input images to be taken far apart and widely distributed around the environment. An Industry Foundation Class-based (IFC-based) BIM is subsequently fused into the as-built scene by a robust registration step and is traversed and labeled for expected progress visibility. Next, a machine-learning scheme built upon a Bayesian probabilistic model is proposed that automatically detects physical progress in the presence of occlusions and demonstrates that physical progress monitoring at schedule activity level could be fully automated. Finally, the system enables the expected and reconstructed elements to be explored with an interactive, image-based, three-dimensional (3D) viewer where deviations are automatically color-coded over the IFC-based BIM. To that extent, the underlying hypotheses and algorithms for generating integrated four-dimensional (4D) as-built and as-planned models plus automated progress monitoring are presented. Experimental results are reported for challenging image data sets collected under different lighting conditions and severe occlusions from two ongoing building construction projects. This marks the presented model as being the first probabilistic model for automated progress tracking and visualization of deviations that incorporates both as-planned models and unordered daily photographs in a principled way.

Back-calculation of pavement layer moduli is an ill-posed inverse engineering problem, which involves searching for the optimal combination of pavement layer stiffness solutions in an unsmooth, multimodal, complex search space. SCE is especially considered a robust and efficient approach for global optimization of multimodal functions. A desirable characteristic of the SCE algorithm is that it uses information about the nature of the response surface, extracted using the deterministic Simplex geometric shape, to direct the search into regions with higher posterior probability.

Thus, an opportunity to characterize multiple handling of materials and, by extension, materials handling processes is being missed. However, efficiently monitoring the position of mobile sensing nodes-the coordinates of which remain unknown-with low-accuracy locations is a nontrivial problem that cannot be likely solved using deterministic or classic probability approaches.

These analytical scenarios varied the grid sizes of spatial meshing, vertical distance of computational topology blocks, and practical transportation distance at each dimension increment throughout the initial design and planning period. The algorithm was then validated by statistically comparing its performance with that of a contemporary location-selection model that does not consider three-dimensional (3D) spiral transportation routes and differential material quality while maximizing the model performance.

A one-dimensional system, in which a fluid layer was surrounded by two solid layers, was considered. The bottom solid layer was truncated using a wave-absorbing boundary condition (WABC). The wave responses were measured by a sensor located on the top surface, and the measured signal contained information about the underlying physical system. Using the measured wave responses, the elastic moduli of the solid layers and the depths of the interfaces between the solid and fluid layers were identified. A multilevel genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a frequency-continuation scheme to invert the values of sought-for parameters was employed. The numerical results showed that (1) the depths of solid-fluid interfaces and elastic moduli can be reconstructed by the presented method, (2) the frequency-continuation scheme improves the convergence of the estimated values of parameters toward their targeted values, and (3) a preliminary inversion using an all-solid model can be employed to identify if a fluid layer exists in the model by showing one layer with a very large value of Young\'s modulus (with a value similar to that of the bulk modulus of water) and a mass density similar to that of water. Then the primary GA inversion method, based on a fluid-solid model, can be utilized to adjust the soil characteristics and fine-tune the locations of the fluid layer. If this work is extended to a 3D setting, it can be instrumental in finding unknown locations of fluid-filled voids in geological formations that can lead to ground instability and/or collapse (e.g., natural or anthropogenic sinkholes, urban cave-in subsidence, and so forth).

Open gears are one of the most critical components of movable bridges. Proper and regular maintenance of these gears is vitally important to ensure a safe, reliable, and cost-effective operation. In this study, a practical and low-cost monitoring approach is presented to track the lubrication level in an open gear of a movable bridge by using video cameras. Two unique indices are developed for monitoring of the open gear by investigating two different image processing methods in a comparative fashion. The first methodology is based on an edge detection algorithm that utilizes a Sobel gradient operator to determine the edges in the open gear image. A lubrication index (LI) based on the edge detection results is defined and extracted to determine the lubrication level.

Automated analysis of sewer CCTV videos poses several challenges including the nonuniformity of camera motion and illumination conditions inside the sewer. The paper presents a novel algorithm for optical flow-based camera motion tracking to automatically identify, locate, and extract a limited set of video segments, called regions of interest (ROI), that likely include defects, thus reducing the time and computational requirements needed for video processing. The proposed algorithm attempts to recover the operator actions during the inspection session, which would enable determining the location and relative severity of the ROI. To ensure proper segmentation and defect detection, frames within the ROI are classified on the basis of the camera orientation using a set of Haar-like features and a multiclass support vector machine. A segmentation algorithm based on gray-level intensity analysis is also presented. Algorithms for automated detection of debris and joint displacement defects are also discussed. The debris detection algorithm employs image segmentation and texture analysis techniques to locate and verify debris objects inside the water flow lines. The joint displacement algorithm performs gray-level intensity analysis to detect joints offset.

Prior research has shown that fusing actual and expected 3D spatiothermal models provide valuable information for analyzing performance gaps. Until now, these methods have primarily focused on detecting and localizing potential performance problems without analyzing their associated cost. A reliable assessment of the cost provides an opportunity to conduct cost-benefit analysis for various retrofit alternatives. It also improves current thermographic inspection which relies on visual detection and qualitative interpretation of thermal irregularities. To this end, this paper presents a new 3D thermography-based method for cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency building envelope retrofits. The method builds on energy performance augmented reality (EPAR) modeling which generates and fuses actual and expected 3D spatiothermal models using collections of thermal and digital images. In the resulting EPAR models, first detect and calculate the building areas associated with potential thermal degradations, and then explore the as-is thermal conditions of the associated building assemblies at 3D vertex-level. Next, using the historical climatic data and the recommended R-values, the amount of the unnecessary heat transfer through the detected areas and the monetary benefits from their retrofit are estimated. Finally, the expected energy cost savings were balanced against the cost of implementing insulation retrofit alternatives. Experimental results on two real-world buildings and four hypothetical cases with different geographical conditions show potential of the proposed method in reliably estimating the return on investment from retrofitting thermal performance problems.

This paper proposes a new infrastructure-free approach for three-dimensional (3D) localization of distant target objects by integrating the following two sources of information on a mobile device: (1)embedded motion sensors in the mobile device such as an accelerometer and gyroscopelocalizing a user equipped with the mobile device through the probabilistic integration of multiple dead-reckoning paths, which provides the location information of each camera center in the global coordinate system; and (2)an embedded visual sensor (i.e.,camera)localizing distant target objects of interest through the image-based 3D localization by leveraging photos taken from multiviews for the objects. To test the proposed method, several case studies were conducted in an existing instructional facility, and approximately 3% of the averaged distance errors were reported. Experimental results promise that the proposed multimodal mobile sensing and analytics have significant potential to robustly localize distant in-building assets and reduce the drift errors accumulated in proportion to the moving distance.

Previous studies provide insight into tracking human movements and recognizing actions, but further research efforts are needed to understand the following characteristics of motion data, which can significantly affect classification performances: (1) various motion data types extracted from motion capture data, (2) variations of postures and actions, and (3) temporal and sequential relations of motion data. This paper thus presents a modeling and classification methodology for the recognition of unsafe actions, particularly focusing on (1) the description and comparison of four motion data types (i.e., rotation angles, joint angles, position vectors, and movement direction) that will be used as a feature for classification, (2) the estimation of actions\' mean trajectory in order to model various patterns of action, and (3) the classification of actions based on spatial-temporal similarity. With a concentration on motion analysis, experiments were undertaken for the modeling and detection of actions during ladder climbing using an red, green, blue plus depth (RGB-D) sensor. Through the experimental study, we found that the proposed approach performs well (i.e., an accuracy of up to 99.5% in lab experiments), that a rotation angle outperforms a joint angle and a position vector, and that movement direction explicitly improves the accuracy of motion classification as combined with each of the other three.

To fight the risk of transmission, new health, safety, and environmental (HSE) protocols have been put in place. Among these protocols are social distancing and limiting the number of workers per area, where social distancing acts as a so-called protective bubble for each worker. Contractors are now required to attempt to achieve (and be prepared to keep) social distancing among their workers whenever needed and possible. Otherwise, they could be forced to halt operations due to having an unsafe environment. Accordingly, construction plans, and corresponding workspace assignments, should be revised in a four-dimensional (4D) environment to ensure fulfillment. Even after the end of this pandemic, the new HSE awareness achieved during this experiment is expected to reshape the so-called new normal of construction. Therefore, this paper presents a novel workspace simulation and management solution comprising a theoretical framework and a semiautomated tool to incorporate physical distancing during 4D planning. The semiautomated tool creates a 4D building information model, loaded with workspaces and social distance bubbles as stochastic variables, and utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to model uncertainties occurring onsite. The uncertainties considered are both temporal and spatial, i.e., changes in productivity and workspace sizes, respectively. This tool surpasses existing workspace management solutions in that (1) it has a schedule generation module to recompute schedule projections based on temporal uncertainties, (2) its workspace generation module can automatically create physical distance buffers around selected workspaces, as per site conditions, (3) its 4D simulation can realistically mimic the work progress on the site, and (4) its 4D clash detection module can smartly detect and report both soft and hard operational clashes. Additionally, the proposed analytics target three levels of clash resolution: site, workspace, and activity level. The framework and developed tool were tested against a residential building case study. Over the course of 155 days, 26 activities with 257 workspace assignments were examined.

Nevertheless, unplanned overlapping without thoroughly modeling the entire procedure may not necessarily reduce design duration but instead result in excessive redesign that can be very costly. Recognizing the necessity of finding an optimal overlapping strategy, this study proposes an integrated decision-making framework to optimize the schedule of the design activities using early information. Given the probabilistic nature of the design process, the overall design process has been modeled using discrete event simulation (DES) incorporating an overlapping concept to produce the expected duration and redesign efforts, which are aggregated as a criterion to evaluate the solution. Subsequently, the search for an optimal overlapping strategy is carried out using an overlapping strategy matrix (OSM) with a genetic algorithm (GA). The entire optimization procedure is implemented by integrating GA with DES in a synchronized manner. Effectiveness of the proposed approach has been discussed through an illustrative example and the results show that the proposed optimization method eliminates unnecessary redesign without significant delay or even with no delay in design completion time.

Researchers interested in measuring decision-making during infrastructure finance negotiations, coordination among stakeholders, or interaction between the built environment and human cognition will benefit from this synthesis. The review includes 32 experiments, and the mean sample size of human participants was 28. Three methods for experimental design include block, event-related, and mixed.

However, existing physics models typically represent deterioration knowledge using mathematical symbols and are limited in capturing the semantic meanings and relationships of the symbols, making the models not understandable and operable by machines. As a result, it is challenging to automatically instantiate mathematical physics models to deduce knowledge-driven deterioration facts to inform the learning. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new structural deterioration knowledge ontology (DT-KL-Onto). The ontology represents structural deterioration knowledge in mathematical physics models as related to structure deficiency, deficiency property, and deficiency contributing factor in a formal, explicit, and semantic way to allow for automated model instantiation. To evaluate the performance of the ontology, the DT-KL-Onto was implemented in automatically instantiating structural deterioration-related mathematical physics models using bridge design, construction, and inspection data. The evaluation results show that the ontology was able to accurately instantiate the models in an automated way: the coefficient of determination and mean squared error between the deterioration facts deduced from the automated instantiation and those from the manual instantiation are 1.0000 and 0.0000, respectively. Two bridge deterioration prediction models were also developed to further demonstrate the benefits of using the deterioration knowledge captured by the ontology to inform the learning. Compared to the purely ML-based prediction model, the physics-informed ML-based prediction model improved the performance of predicting the condition ratings of concrete decks by 10.0%. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering an ontology that can semantically represent structural deterioration knowledge in mathematical physics models to enable automated model instantiation.

This results in a customized algorithm for the problem that can be regarded as an example of a guided genetic algorithm (GGA). To cut down on execution time, a distributed implementation of the algorithm is adopted, and several software design procedures are developed to deal with the demanding memory requirements of the problem.

The GGA is then utilized to estimate the dynamic demand for those two models on the basis of hourly traffic count information. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the GGA in dramatically reducing the average absolute error (AAE) between the simulated and field counts, and in closely estimating the true demand, which was known in this research by virtue of how the case studies were designed.

In addition, and especially in the case of reality captures conducted with camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), operational requirements-including battery capacity and operator\'s line of sight (LOS)-should be carefully considered for safe flight execution. Accounting for these technical and operational requirements during reality capture planning requires expertise.

Generally, a balance between these strategies often receives the support of the population insofar as that does not lead to a reduction of quality of life. In this respect, (urban) open spaces, which nowadays constitute an important element of healthy cities, are sometimes designed for optimal maintenance cost rather than quality of life. For instance, in the case of the City of Edmonton, Canada, although (approximately) 10% of the Neighborhood Structure Plan (NSP) is required to be used as parks, residents do not equally reap the benefit of this green space. In fact, the municipality encourages land developers to keep this open space in the form of large areas (usually one or two), arguing that a scattered design will increase maintenance costs. In an effort to answer this question, it is shown that even though maintenance costs of neighborhood parks increase because of a scattered design, the proximity of additional homes to open green spaces increases their values, and hence their property taxes, which cumulatively exceed the maintenance cost differential.

In aerial imagery, structure from motion (SfM) is often used for three-dimensional (3D) point reconstruction (i.e., ground locations) and for camera pose estimation (i.e., airborne position and orientation) from a set of geometrically matched features between two-dimensional (2D) images. In order to improve the correspondence estimation, outliers (defined as gross misassociated features) are determined and excluded using an outlier rejection algorithm such as random sample consensus (RANSAC); however, in practice, it is impossible to ensure that outlier rejection algorithms always lead to perfect feature correspondences. Consequently, there remain misassociations between matched features in different views that significantly lower the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene reconstruction algorithms. This paper introduces an adaptive resection-intersection bundle adjustment approach that refines the 3D points and camera poses separately after the gross misassociations are removed by an outlier rejection algorithm. For each iteration, the proposed approach identifies the potential misassociated features independently in the resection as well as the intersection stage, where these potential outliers, contrary to previous studies, are reexamined at later iterations. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach leads to smaller 3D reconstruction errors by rejecting almost all of the misassociations as outliers while the maximum number of inlier matched features are retained. The results from several numerical simulations and real data sets are presented, and it is shown that the proposed approach outperforms existing bundle adjustment (BA) approaches in the presence of misassociated features although the convergence rate is slower.

The performance of the comfort-profiling algorithm was assessed using human subject data and synthetically generated data.

In this context, this research tests the usefulness of the maximum Lyapunov exponents (Max LE) as a metric to assess construction workers\' comprehensive fall risk. Max LE, one of the gait-stability metrics established in clinical settings, estimates how the stability of a construction worker reacts to very small disruptions. In order to validate the use of Max LE, a laboratory experiment that asked a group of subjects to simulate iron workers\' walking tasks on an I-beam was designed and conducted. These tasks were designed to showcase various fall-risk profiles: walking with a comfortable walking speed presented a low fall-risk profile; carrying a one-sided load and walking at a faster speed on the I-beam both presented high fall-risk profiles. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors were attached to the right ankle of participants\' bodies to collect kinematic data for the calculation of Max LE. The results showed that Max LE offers adequate distinguishing power for characterizing the fall risk of various construction workers\' tasks, and the introduced approach to compute the gait stability from IMU sensor data captured from human bodies could provide a valuable analysis of the safety-related risks present in construction workers\' motions.

Recently, an off-the-shelf wearable EEG device, which is wireless, lightweight, and affordable, has become available so that field construction workers\' psychosocial status can be explored without interfering with their ongoing work. However, capturing high-quality EEG signals from such a device can be very challenging at real construction sites because of the signal artifacts generated by body movement caused by physically demanding work. To address this issue, the authors propose an EEG signal-processing framework that can acquire high-quality EEG signals at real construction sites using a wearable EEG device. Specifically, the signal-processing framework reduces noises and is thus able to extract quality EEG signals. This framework is validated by examining whether brain activation (particularly by body movements) can be identified using the processed EEG signal applied to eight field construction workers under working (i.e., active) and not working (i.e., inactive) conditions. Specifically, mean power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG beta frequency range is calculated from electrodes near the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls voluntary movements. A significant difference in mean PSD in the beta frequency range between active and inactive conditions demonstrates that the processed EEG signal, based on the proposed framework, captures brain activation. The results show the potential of the proposed signal-processing framework to monitor workers\' brain wave patterns in the field with a wearable EEG device, opening up an opportunity to assess workers\' psychosocial status in construction so that any psychosocial problems of workers can be investigated.

To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents a genetic algorithm (GA)-based acoustic-source inversion algorithm to identify the amplitudes, positions, and speeds of multiple moving sources by using wave motions recorded at sensors within a heterogeneous one-dimensional solid bar system without knowing the number of targets. To this end, the authors cast this problem into an inverse-source problem, in which solutions can be obtained via minimization of a misfit between measured wave responses and numerically computed responses found using estimated parameters. The wave responses due to moving sources are computed by using the finite element method (FEM) in the time domain. The presented FEM modeling successfully captures the shifts of frequency contents (i.e., the Doppler effect) of wave responses that are generated by moving wave sources. The numerical results, for which the GA is used for the minimization process, show that it is possible to detect the parameters of moving sources in a heterogeneous host without knowing how many targeted sources exist in advance. It is also observed that greater computational cost (i.e., iteration number of the GA) and denser distribution of sensors are required to detect a larger number of moving wave sources. Similarly, larger computational costs are required for a heterogeneous host than a homogeneous one.

Results displayed that the intended framework successfully produced 300,000 training images in 1 h, about 500 times faster than human resources, and an enhanced tracker performed well even in the case of unsatisfactory detection results.

Because FoS for most slopes in practice is computed numerically due to the lack of analytical solutions, various surrogate models are usually developed to ease the probabilistic evaluation. This paper investigates the probability of slope system failure with surrogate models based on the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression. First, some limitations in the current application of LS-SVM to complex slopes with multiple failure modes are pointed out. In the context of Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for probabilistic slope stability evaluation, the authors first discuss the importance of space filling of training data to the success of the LS-SVM and then propose an efficient routine for generating the training data by which the global prediction of FoS is reasonably guaranteed. The application of the LS-SVM is illustrated through two well-documented slope examples. Comparative studies are conducted to identify the effect of training data size and hyperparameters on the model performance. It is observed from this study that the LS-SVM model can reasonably capture the global characteristics of complex slopes only when all the relevant soil layers are treated probabilistically; otherwise, some local inconsistency could be encountered. Focusing on the probability of failure prediction defined by different FoS thresholds, it is shown that the LS-SVM is robust and a promising method for the evaluation of complex slopes.

In practice, the square foot method, considered an effective method for time-saving, is widely used. However, this method requires a great amount of effort to calculate a unit price and does not consider the uniqueness of each case. Thus, the use of the square foot method could bring about unwanted consequences. For example, in the case of military projects in Korea, significant differences have been reported between estimations made using this method and the actual costs. In an effort to deal with this challenging issue, this research develops a military facility cost estimation (MilFaCE) system, based on case-based reasoning (CBR), using case data from 422 construction projects at 16 military facilities. Based on system validation experiments involving 10 military officers (engineers), the effectiveness of the system in terms of estimation accuracy and user-friendliness is confirmed. Consequently, this research can be a CBR application example of construction cost estimation and a basis for further research into the development of cost estimate systems.

It allows for the creation of flexible geometric models using parameters for dimensions and makes it possible to define numeric relationships between these parameters by means of mathematical formulas and define geometric-topological constraints between geometric entities. The result is a flexible geometric model that can be steered through the manipulation of its primary parameters. In contrast to explicit geometric models with fixed dimensions, a parametric model can capture the design intent and represent domain knowledge. The use of parametric modeling techniques is particularly beneficial for designing bridges. This is because the geometric design of bridges is mainly determined by external constraints resulting from the size and the layout of both the overlying and the undercrossing carriageway. This reduces the effort required for reworking when changes are made, while simultaneously providing a high degree of reusability for the model in other, similar projects, resulting in significantly increased efficiency in the bridge design process. Because of the strong fragmentation of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the data exchange between the different participants in a construction project is of crucial importance. The use of neutral, open data formats has proved to be the most suitable approach to realize this data exchange. However, currently existing neutral data formats do not allow for an exchange of parametric geometry. To overcome these technical limitations, this paper introduces an extension to the IFC-Bridge format, thus providing a means of interchanging parametric bridge models. This article describes in detail the necessary entities introduced to define parameters and capture dimensional and geometric constraints. The suitability of the developed extensions is proved by presenting the successful transfer of parametric bridge models between two parametric design systems as well as from a design system to a structural analysis system.

In the past few decades the geographic information system (GIS) and analysis has provided a platform for data analysis because of its strong capabilities in spatial visualization. In this study, a monitoring system that can be applied to hydropower projects is developed on the basis of the powerful spatial visualization and analysis characteristics of GIS. The main tasks of the system are (1) to model instruments and measuring points distinctively according to different perspectives on the basis of the implementation of a set of spatial data modeling tools; (2) to visualize and query spatial data based on their spatial positions; and (3) to display data using three analytical modules. Because of the visual limitations of each of the different modules, the measured values are shown in different ways. In addition, spatial analysis, including interpolation and surface analysis, can be conducted in each module. The proposed system promotes the spatial aspect of hydropower monitoring analysis and is expected to be an efficient tool for improving and maintaining the safety standard for the construction of hydropower stations.

However, most existing algorithms using two-dimensional (2D) pavement intensity images cannot provide a satisfactory performance. With the advent of sensing technology, three-dimensional (3D) line laser pavement imaging systems have become available. The objective of this paper is to propose an enhanced dynamic optimization algorithm employing the advantages of 3D pavement data to improve crack segmentation. The proposed algorithm consists of three major stages. First, a two-step Gaussian filter is applied to remove outliers from the collected laser data and rectify the profile in order to reduce the influence of cross-slope and ruts on crack segmentation. Then, a rough crack segmentation stage is conducted to adaptively identify the crack regions of interest. Finally, a bounding box and major orientation for each valid crack region of interest will provide searching space and direction for the precise crack segmentation using the dynamic optimization algorithm. Experimental tests were conducted using actual pavement data collected near Savannah, Georgia. The four most common types of pavement cracking (longitudinal, transverse, block, and alligator cracking), as well as distress-free pavements, are tested, and the performance between original dynamic optimization algorithm and the proposed algorithm is compared. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm take only about 1/4 of the average computation time of the original algorithm. Also, the accuracy of crack segmentation has been improved since the proposed algorithm removes the unnecessary false positives and handles cracks in multiple directions better.

However, only a handful or institutions around the world teach structural response to fire (at any level) and only a few of the top consulting engineers in the world truly specialize in this niche area. Among the reasons for this are the lack of cheap and easily accessible software to carry out such analyses and the highly tedious nature of modeling the full (often coupled) sequence of a realistic fire scenario, heat transfer to structure and structural response (currently impossible using a single software). The authors in this paper describe how finite-element software can be extended to include the modeling of structures under fire load. The added advantage of extending existing finite-element codes, as opposed to creating fire-specific applications, is due to ability to perform multihazard type analysis, e.g., fire following earthquake. Due to its open source nature and object-oriented design, the OpenSees software framework is used for this purpose. In this work, the OpenSees framework, which was initially designed for the earthquake analysis of structures, is extended by the addition of new concrete classes for thermal loads, temperature distributions across element cross sections, and material laws based on Eurocodes. Through class and sequence diagrams, this paper shows the interaction of these classes with the existing classes in the OpenSees framework. The performance of this development is tested using benchmark solutions of a single beam with finite stiffness boundary conditions and a steel frame test. The results from OpenSees agree well with analytical solutions for the benchmark problem chosen and provide reasonable agreement with the test. The experience with OpenSees so far suggests that it has excellent potential to be the basis of a unified software framework for enabling computational modeling of realistic fires, and further work is continuing towards the achievement of this goal. The extensions made to OpenSees described in this work, in keeping with the open source ideals of the framework, have been included in the current OpenSees code and are available for researchers and practicing engineers to test, develop, and use for their own purposes.

Due to budget and time constraints, engineers typically rely on engineering judgment and prior experience when selecting a structural system, often considering a limited range of design alternatives. The objective of this study was to explore the suitability of supervised machine learning as a preliminary design aid that provides guidance to engineers with regards to the statistically optimal bridge type to choose, ultimately improving the likelihood of optimized design, design standardization, and reduced maintenance costs. In order to devise this supervised learning system, data for more than 600,000 bridges from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database were analyzed. Key attributes for determining the bridge structure type were identified through three feature selection techniques. Potentially useful attributes like seismic intensity and historic data on the cost of materials (steel and concrete) were then added. Decision tree, Bayes network, and support vector machines were used for predicting the bridge design type. Due to state-to-state variations in material availability, material costs, and design codes, supervised learning models based on the complete data set did not yield favorable results. Supervised learning models were then trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation on data for each state. Inclusion of seismic data improved the model performance noticeably. The data were then resampled to reduce the bias of the models toward more common design types, and the supervised learning models thus constructed showed further improvements in performance. The average recall and precision for the state models were 88.6 and 88.0% using decision trees, 84.0 and 83.7% using Bayesian networks, and 80.8 and 75.6% using SVM.

Since the intensity of the umbra shadow area changes homogeneously, the ICM approach can be a convenient way for shadow removal. While the intensity of penumbra area changes drastically, the cubic sample interpolation operation was conducted in advance, followed by ICM to finalize the shadow removal.

Typically, flood routing and inundation prediction is accomplished by using one-dimensional (1D) models. These have been the models of choice because they are computationally simple and quick. However, these models do not adequately represent the complex physical processes present for shallow flows located in the floodplain or in urban areas. Two-dimensional (2D) models developed on the basis of the full hydrodynamic equations can be used to represent the complex flow phenomena that exist in the floodplain and are, therefore, recommended by the National Research Council for increased use in flood analysis studies. The major limitation of these models is the increased computational cost. Two-dimensional flood models are prime candidates for parallel computing, but traditional methods/equipment (e. g., message passing paradigm) are more complex in terms of code refactoring and hardware setup. In addition, these hardware systems may not be available or accessible to modelers conducting flood analyses. This paper presents a 2D flood model that implements multithreading for use on now-prevalent multicore computers.

This paper proposes a scheme for automated 3D geometric modeling of indoor structures, including detailed components such as windows and open doors. Moreover, to produce a regularized model, we imposed constrained least-squares adjustment according to an assumption made with respect to typical indoor structures: walls, ceiling, floor, doors, and windows are composed of straight lines, either parallel or orthogonal. Modeling proceeds in two main phases: wall modeling and window modeling. In the wall modeling phase, the point-cloud acquisitions are projected onto a 2D binary image and the wall boundary is traced out. The boundary is regularized by means of the constrained least-squares method, and, thereby, a 2D floor boundary map can be obtained that later produces, by incorporation of a RANdom sample consensus-based height estimation, a 3D wall model. In the window modeling phase, the wall points are each projected onto a 2D inverse binary image to detect the hollow parts, after which image-based filtering removes incorrect detections. The lines, representing the four window edges, are extracted and adjusted again using the constrained least-squares method. Finally, the window models are projected back onto the original coordinates, and the complete 3D wireframe model is obtained.

In designing a construction lift system, it becomes essential to carry out a quantitative performance analysis and comparison of system alternatives. However, traditional simulation methods of modeling global system processes inhibit the evaluation of multiple system alternatives with their own distinct global processes. Therefore, this study aims to address such deficiencies by developing an agent-based simulation method, beginning with a literature review on lift systems intended to examine the external and internal factors affecting system performance. An agent-based simulation method is then used by modeling the behavioral rules of system components (e.g., lift cars and workers). Simulation experiments are conducted alongside assessments of the performance of seven lift system alternatives with unique system processes. The resulting research reveals the complex relationship among configuration of service floors, lift car range, and system performance, thereby suggesting how agent-based modeling techniques can contribute to the analysis of operational-level systems with diverse global system processes.

Over the last few years, many research efforts have focused on applying deep learning-based techniques to automatically detect cracks in images. Good results have been reported with bounding boxes around the detected cracks in images. However, there is no accurate crack segmentation, quantitative assessment, or integrated visualization in the context of engineering structures. In addition, most previously developed deep learning-based crack detection models have been trained with homogenous images collected under controlled conditions, rather than applying the models to images collected during real-world infrastructure inspections. In this paper, two deep learning-based approaches are developed for crack detection and segmentation. The first approach is to integrate the faster region-based convolutional neural network (FRCNN) with structured random forest edge detection (SRFED). The FRCNN is used to detect cracks with bounding boxes while SRFED is applied to segment the cracks within the boxes. The second approach is to directly apply Mask RCNN for crack detection and segmentation.

In this regard, jobsites and laydown yards that involve construction materials such as gravel piles and crushed rocks could be the main sources of potential windborne debris during extreme wind events. To analyze safety risk and predict the damage imposed by jobsite debris to nearby built environments, a new computer vision-based risk assessment based on geometric digital twins of jobsite debris is proposed for the reliability analysis on glazing systems of dwellings located on nearby jobsites. The impact of a gravel pile in a railroad jobsite on nearby buildings and residential environments was studied based on extreme wind event scenarios, and the failure risk of the building glazing system was computed. The risk associated with jobsite debris during extreme wind events and their impact on neighboring communities are analyzed through three computing modules: (1) satellite imagery-based terrain modeling to study 3D characteristics of the at-risk built environment; (2) analyzing visual data from Google Street View to assess the risk associated with glazing panels of dwellings in the communities; and (3) analyzing visual data from a jobsite to quantify the impact of jobsite debris, to associate its safety risk to neighboring communities. The proposed method can provide an immediate heads up for those who reside nearby jobsites, allowing to take required preemptive actions to protect their habitation against potential windbome debris. Practitioners will also be informed of such jobsite debris-related risk before extreme wind events to better secure their jobsites for the risk mitigation.

The majority of prior studies have emphasized supervised machine learning, assuming the ability to collect labeled data for model development. However, variances in vehicle dynamics and roadway quality, as well as the reliance on data labeling, limit the generalizability, scalability, and reproducibility of these approaches. Here, we propose an unsupervised learning framework that combines Pareto-optimized wavelet featurization and clustering. We first demonstrate the applicability of wavelets as features for dimensionally reduced accelerometer data. Wavelet featurization typically requires significant empirical tuning for optimal featurization. The presented framework automates tuning and selection of wavelet features based on subsequent clustering metrics. These metrics are related to inherent cluster characteristics such as intercluster variance and between-cluster variance. Rather than select a clustering method a priori, the proposed approach optimizes across a variety of clustering algorithms and hyperparameter configurations, again based on a set of clustering metrics. Experimental evaluation shows that the framework is able to detect road pavement distress and distinguish between classes of pavement defects, but that low-cost smartphone sensor data may not be as reliable in discriminating the more nuanced characteristics of pavement distress. This was most notable in the case of cracking, where the type and range of cracking severity caused undesirable cluster separation. The presented framework is general and cost-efficient and opens the way to further research on automatic pavement distress recognition from crowdsourced, low-cost data.

The aim of this study is to develop a MAS that simulates the negotiation process between parties (mainly contractor and client) about risk allocation and sharing of cost overruns in construction projects. The MAS was developed using three different negotiation protocols: time-dependent concession, Zeuthen\'s strategy, and Zeuthen\'s strategy with Bayesian learning. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect of reservation value, first-offer value, and negotiation protocol on the settlement amounts. The model was also tested on three hypothetical cases. Results show that it is mainly the reservation value that determines the settlement amount of the negotiation.

The key components of the system are four main modules: database management, inflow modeling and forecasting, operation management, and real-time operation. Flexibility is the key feature of the system, providing the users with different decision tools and different indices for measuring the performance of each tool. A cost function is developed based on the present value of the total capital cost and the cost of operation and maintenance of the system. This cost function, which is developed based on reasonable estimates of water and energy prices, is used to measure the performance of reservoir operation policies. A utility function based on multicriterion decision making (MCDM) that uses an analytical hierarchy process is also developed. The MCDM utility function enables decision makers to incorporate the priority of different objectives in developing optimal operating policies and can be effectively used when the priority of objectives is not clear and the decision-making process relies mainly on the decision maker\'s preferences. Both economic and MCDM utility functions are implemented and coupled with deterministic and stochastic optimization models.

Available energy optimization models are able to find minimum-cost housing design and construction decisions at different target energy-saving levels.

This paper presents a scalable and expandable parallel computing framework to reduce the computational time that is required to optimize the trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial cost. The framework is designed as a global parallel optimization algorithm to provide an efficient distribution of the multiobjective genetic algorithm computations over a number of parallel processors. The optimization algorithm is also coupled with an external building energy simulation engine to enable an accurate modeling of housing energy performance. The performance of the parallel computing framework was tested using seven experiments that utilized 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 worker processors. The results of this analysis illustrated that the present framework is able to reduce the computational elapsed time from 12days to 1.7days by utilizing eight parallel worker processors that are commonly found on many PCs with quad core and eight threads. This significant reduction in the elapsed time proves that the developed parallel computing framework is capable of transforming the optimization of housing units from a time-consuming and often impractical problem to a feasible and practical one.

Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods, including falling weight deflectometer (FWD), are the most widely used monitoring approach. The FWD device creates an impulse load on the pavement surface, and the resulting pavement surface deflections are captured using geophones at a number of distances from the load. Various backcalculation methods have been proposed to calculate pavement structural properties from FWD surface deflection measurements. However, no unique technique has proved to yield a globally optimum solution to this complex, nondifferentiable problem. This study explores development of an effective and reliable backcalculation strategy with attention to variable layer thicknesses. A synthetic database of typical three-layer flexible pavement structures is created by a three-dimensional finite-element method (FEM) program. To replace computationally intensive FEM routines, artificial neural networks (ANNs)massively parallel computing systemsare trained and tested using the synthetic data. To minimize the error between the FWD-measured deflections and ANN-calculated deflections, a restart covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is implemented. This strategy is superior to most available evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in efficient, effective, and reliable optimization of complex test functions. Testing of the developed methodology (RCMA-BC) on the synthetic database demonstrates its effectiveness and reliability in backcalculating moduli and surface layer thickness. However, RCMA-BC cannot reliably backcalculate base thickness because the forward calculation routine does not have significant sensitivity to this parameter. Additionally, the RCMA-BC models and backcalculation software are applied to data from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database; RCMA-BC exhibits consistently lower errors in deflections.

Literature studies demonstrate that BA provides good results in a wide range of optimization problems due to its simple structures, easy implementation, and effectiveness. However, the standard BA has two general shortcomings when applied to complex optimization problems. The first is the high probability of falling in local optima, and the second is insufficient population diversity, leading to unwanted premature convergence. This paper proposes an improved bat algorithm based on the Doppler effect (IBA-DE) to improve the performance of the standard BA. In the proposed IBA-DE, a new equation with some idealized rules is driven from the Doppler effect and adopted for updating the bat velocities in the algorithm body. The local search part of the standard BA is also improved via searching around the better bat individuals. This part is also equipped with Levy flight to maintain the population diversity. The performance of IBA-DE is evaluated on three real-world engineering design problems. The results obtained by these problems show that IBA-DE is superior to the basic BA and other considered algorithms. For further investigation, IBA-DE is applied to the optimal design of four special truss structures.

Because energy consumption fluctuates over time, the efficiency scores are stochastic random variables. Existing applications of frontier methods in energy efficiency either treat efficiency scores as deterministic values or estimate their uncertainty by resampling from one set of measurements. Availability of smart meter data (repeated measurements of energy consumption of buildings) enables using actual data to estimate the uncertainty in efficiency scores. Additionally, existing applications assume a linear form for an efficient frontier; i.e.,they assume that the best-practice technology scales up and down proportionally with building characteristics. However, previous research shows that buildings are nonlinear systems. This paper proposes a statistical method called stochastic energy efficiency frontier (SEEF) to estimate a bias-corrected efficiency score and its confidence intervals from measured data. The paper proposes an algorithm to specify the functional form of the frontier, identify the probability distribution of the efficiency score of each building using measured data, and rank buildings based on their energy efficiency. To illustrate the power of SEEF, this paper presents the results from applying SEEF on a smart meter data set of 307 residential buildings in the United States. SEEF efficiency scores are used to rank individual buildings based on energy efficiency, to compare subpopulations of buildings, and to identify irregular behavior of buildings across different time-of-use periods. SEEF is an improvement to the energy-intensity method (comparing kWh/sq.ft.): whereas SEEF identifies efficient buildings across the entire spectrum of building sizes, the energy-intensity method showed bias toward smaller buildings.

In this paper, an industry foundation class (IFC)-based system is developed to configure groupings of precast elements for a prefabricated building to minimize the total number of components so as to reduce the production, transportation, and installation cost. The framework uses three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) software that is compatible with IFC. Geometrical and topological relationships of elements are extracted from IFC and modeled as a graph data model (GDM). The system performs analysis on the graph model based on the attributes of the building elements to generate all possible configurations for precasting. Constructability rules are applied to reduce the solutions to feasible configurations. The functionality of the developed framework is verified by considering an illustrative example of a residential building.

Roundabouts facilitate reduced vehicle delays with naturally optimized conflict resolution for turning traffic, which also reduces the risks of severe crashes. However, evaluating the roundabout capacity for multilane configurations can be challenging due to the randomized decision making to accept or reject a headway to enter the roundabout. In addition, considering the follow-up headway between two vehicles entering the roundabout from the same lane is critical to evaluate accurate roundabout capacity. Several manual techniques are popularly used to evaluate roundabout capacity using computer vision powered by multiple video cameras and observers. However, manual processing of videos with a narrow field of view (FoV) requires significant computational effort. Traditional techniques used in manual processing involve a complex two-step time stamp recording and interpreting the parameters required for capacity evaluation. In this case study, a one-step gap-based methodology is proposed to accurately measure the roundabout capacity parameters. In addition, a computer vision algorithm is developed to integrate with deep learning to detect and track vehicular traffic in a multilane roundabout. A software-defined technique is developed to process videos with wider FoV powered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and evaluate roundabout capacity parameters, such as accept, reject, and follow-up headways. Furthermore, the mean critical headway is calculated using a maximum likelihood estimation method. The evaluated roundabout capacity parameters are compared with manual technique results, and the corresponding values are published in the current standards.

Neutron and X-ray imaging provide complementary information for precisely identifying the three phases (silica sand, air, and water) of a compacted sand specimen that is partially saturated. Neutron tomography provides high contrast of the water phase, whereas X-ray tomography provides high contrast of the silica sand phase due to different fundamental interaction mechanisms of neutron and X-ray with matters. X-ray interacts with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, whereas neutron radiation interacts with the nucleus of an atom. In this paper, a computational technique was developed to unify digital images of dual-modal data obtained at different image resolution and specimen orientations based on the maximization of the normalized mutual information to combine the information from the water phase inferred from a neutron image and information from the sand and pore phases obtained from an X-ray image. The combined microstructure obtained from registered X-ray and neutron images can thus be analyzed in 3D to precisely differentiate silica, air, and water distribution spatially. Microstructure information for granular assembly including pore size distribution and coordination number was determined from X-ray tomography data due to higher precision in identifying solid particle boundaries.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep convolutional network-based construction object-detection method to accurately recognize construction equipment. A deep convolutional network can achieve high performance in various visual tasks, but is not easy to be applied in the construction industry where there is not enough publicly available data for training. This problem is solved by transfer learning, which trains a model for the construction industry by transferring the knowledge of models trained in other domains with a large amount of training data. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark data set is created for five classes: a dump truck, excavator, loader, concrete mixer truck, and road roller. This benchmark data set includes various shapes and poses for each class to evaluate the generalization performance of the proposed construction equipment detection model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs remarkably well, achieving 96.33% mean average precision.

To address this safety issue, this paper presents an on-site safety-assessment system for monitoring struck-by accidents with moving entities based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Computer vision is used to monitor a construction site and extract spatial information for each entity (workers and equipment). Next, fuzzy inference is used to assess the proper safety levels of each entity using spatial information. A safety level represents the potential hazard or the integrating danger that a person encounters at a particular moment. Struck-by accidents are selected as a target safety hazard for validation. The proposed system is expected to provide valuable information regarding worker safety represented as a numerical value. Using the record of safety levels, site managers can improve current working practices.

Defect-sensitive features, which have complementary properties to each other, are developed and combined for improved localization and quantification of spalling defects. A defect classifier is developed to automatically diagnose whether the investigated surface region is damaged, where the defect is located, and how large it is.

Although many research efforts have been made on automatic point cloud registration, prior works have some limitations. Automatic registration was tested in a bounded region and required a large overlapped area between scans. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel method that achieves automatic point cloud registration in an unbounded region and with a relatively small overlapped area without using artificial targets, landmarks, or any other manual alignment process. For automatic point cloud registration, the proposed framework uses the feature detection algorithms commonly used in computer vision to identify geometric correspondences among the series of scans for the initial alignment. Then, it computes the overlapped area between scans and determines a method to use for the final alignment. If the overlapped area is sufficiently large, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to generate the proper transformation. Otherwise, a plane-matching algorithm is used to achieve precise registration. The proposed framework was tested at outdoor construction sites and an indoor environment, which resulted in deviation angle accuracy of less than 0.35 degrees for outdoor and 0.13 degrees for indoor testbeds, respectively, with processing time of less than 4 min. These promising results demonstrate that the proposed target-free automatic registration method can significantly reduce the manual registration time and data gathering time without compromising the registration accuracy, thus simplifying and promoting laser scanning practices in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management (AEC/FM) industry.

As pipes in a water distribution network age in service, they are characterized by increased frequency of breakage and decreased hydraulic capacity. The resulting service failures incur utility costs for the repair or rehabilitation of the pipe systems and consumer costs for degraded system performance. The challenge to the decision maker is to determine the most cost-effective plan in terms of what pipes in the network to rehabilitate, by which rehabilitation alternative and at what time in the planning horizon, subject to the constraints of service requirements (system reliability, service pressure, etc.) A dynamic programming approach, combined with partial and implicit enumeration schemes, was used to search the vast combinatorial solution space that this problem presents. A computer program was written to implement these concepts. A hydraulic network solver is used by the program to assure the network conformance to hydraulic constraints during the search for a solution. The outcome is a strategy that identifies, for each pipe in the network, the optimal rehabilitation/renewal alternative and its optimal time of implementation. The significance of this method is in its ability to identify an optimal rehabilitation strategy while considering the deterioration of both structural integrity and hydraulic capacity of the entire network.

Distinguishing the role and status of activities in turn requires planners to understand the rationale for activity sequences. The current critical path method (CPM) framework, however, represents sequencing rationale using precedence relationships and distinguishes activities only with respect to their time-criticality. Thus, planners find it difficult to keep track of individual sequencing logic, and manually inferring the role and status of activities becomes practically prohibitive in complex project schedules.

The platform is capable of handling BIM-based data from multiple design tools; yet it is generic enough to accept almost any design-related software tool.

Because of these complications, studies are often limited to calibration periods of only a few years even when analyzing long time-scale issues such as climate and land-use changes that are difficult or impossible to reproduce. High-level, open source programming languages provide an environment for automating the extraction and processing of various sources of data in addition to the calibration process required by HSPF.

The primary purpose of the research summarized in the paper is to develop a multiscale clustering model by taking advantage of 3D pavement surface images. A preprocessing procedure is carried out to obtain an initially identified crack image (by a CrackSeed-based approach). A cracking region is then characterized by a minimum circumscribed rectangle as the basic unit of the clustering. Then multiscale features are used as the crack unit. Linear crack categories and intensities are classified according to an orientation angle to the length-width ratio, while netted cracks are recognized on the basis of block features. Meanwhile, the optimized spatial distance between the crack subblocks is calculated to precisely locate pavement crack. Finally, a multiscale criterion is applied to quantitatively analyze the degree of road surface damage. In classifying transverse cracks, longitudinal cracks, block cracks, and alligator cracks in 320 crack images, the classification precision is 92.8%, 95.2%, 87.8%, and 97.6%, respectively.

Moreover, the majority of these models rely on the single-agent modeling assumption (i.e., the remaining agents are considered components of a fixed and stationary environment). Nevertheless, this framework is not realistic, which can limit the models\' representation of the real world. This study used a Markov Game (MG) for modeling concurrent road users\' behavior and evasive actions in near misses. Unlike the conventional game-theoretic approach that considers single-time-step modeling, the MG framework models the sequences of road user decisions. In this framework, road users are modeled as rational agents that aim to maximize their own utility functions by taking rational actions. Road user utility functions are recovered from examples of conflict trajectories using a multiagent adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (MAAIRL) framework. In this study, trajectories from conflicts between motorcyclists and pedestrians in Shanghai, China, were used. Road user policies and collision avoidance strategies in near misses were determined with multiagent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning. A multiagent simulation platform was implemented to emulate pedestrian and motorcyclist trajectories. The results demonstrated that the multiagent model outperformed a Gaussian process inverse reinforcement learning single-agent model in predicting road user trajectories and their evasive actions. The MAAIRL model predicted the interactions\' postencroachment time with high accuracy. Moreover, unlike the single-agent framework, the recovered multiagent reward function captured the equilibrium concept in road user interactions.

Differences in meaning of data elements may lead to miscommunication between data senders and receivers. Semantic relations between terms in digital dictionaries, such as ontologies, can enable the semantics of a data element to be transparent and unambiguous to computer systems. However, because of the lack of effective automated methods, identifying these relations is labor intensive and time consuming. This paper presents a novel integrated methodology that leverages multiple computational techniques to extract heterogeneous American-English data terms used in different highway agencies and their semantic relations from design manuals and other technical specifications. The proposed method implements natural language processing (NLP) to detect data elements from text documents and uses machine learning to determine the semantic relatedness among terms using their occurrence statistics in a corpus. The study also consists of developing an algorithm that classifies semantically related terms into three different lexical groups including synonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy. The key merit in this technique is that the detection of semantic relations uses only linguistic information in texts and does not depend on other existing hand-coded semantic resources. A case study was undertaken that implemented the proposed method on a 16-million-word corpus of roadway design manuals to extract and classify roadway data items.

Because the routine variability of activities of daily living (ADLs) can act as an index of an older adult\'s mental status, various research has attempted to develop a metric that can quantify and measure ADL routine variability. However, this research has focused either on the assessment of a single key ADL or the differences between activities performed on consecutive days. These approaches cannot measure the periodic changes over the long term (e.g., when the performed routine is different for each day of the week, or when exceptional events occurred) that may reflect mental health status. This study hypothesizes that the level of image complexity of the visualized data in ADL logs can represent the level of routine variability. To test this hypothesis, synthetic images are designed and generated presenting various randomness in ADL routines [i.e., varying the duration of routine-contributing activities (RADLs), varying the number of occurrences of non-routine-contributing activities (NRADLs), and varying the order of RADLs]. The correlations between each type of variability and the complexity values are identified, and values from canny edge distance and contrast of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) elements show a strong correlation with the variability in the visualized data of the ADL logs. The metrics are further evaluated by using data collected from older adults living alone in real residential environments.

However, the benefits of 2D strain measurements are only worthwhile if a similar level of measurement accuracy to conventional strain gauges can be achieved. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the optimum strain measurement accuracy that can be achieved by using the 2D technique on artificial images (which eliminate errors associated with cameras and lighting). The principle of the 2D DIC technique and its historical development will be introduced. Then, three potential techniques for taking strain measurements will be presented and compared: single readings, averaged linear readings, and an approach on the basis of Mohr\'s circle. The Mohr\'s circle approach was found to be the most accurate and was not susceptible to image misalignment. Strain measurement accuracy was also found to be affected by the bias error of the subpixel interpolation scheme, but the use of an 8 coefficient B-spline was found to produce satisfactory results within the error of conventional strain gauges. Gauge length was also found to have a significant effect on strain measurement accuracy, indicating that measuring strains in a material in which there are variations across the strain field could result in a loss of measurement accuracy.

Recent wearable electrodermal activity (EDA) sensing has shown the potential to meet this need by continuously, less invasively, and less laboriously monitoring individuals\' stress levels as an important dimension of the quality of interaction with the built environment. However, analyzing EDA to detect stress is still challenging due to significant intrinsic and extrinsic noises in EDA collected by a wearable biosensor in the field. Although several denoising methods have been proposed based on differences in signal characteristics between noises and desired EDA signals evoked by sources of interest (e.g., stress), these methods do not address intrinsic respiration noise due to similarities in the signal characteristics of respiration noise and desired EDA signals. To address this issue, the authors propose a denoising method that references simultaneously collected photoplethysmography (PPG) as a respiration noise-correlated signal to attenuate respiration noise as well as extrinsic noises. The performance of the proposed method was compared with advanced benchmark denoising methods using 25 subjects\' stress data collected in the field. As a result, stress metrics calculated from EDA denoised using the proposed method were statistically more valid and reliable than ones from EDA denoised by benchmark denoising methods. Accordingly, machine learning models trained by having the stress metrics as features showed statistically higher accuracy with EDA denoised by the proposed method than by benchmark denoising methods. These results show that the proposed method can improve stress measurement using EDA by attenuating both intrinsic respiration noise and extrinsic noise. The finding contributes to the body of knowledge by demonstrating that intrinsic noise with signal characteristics indistinguishable from desirable signals can be suppressed by referencing another noise-correlated signal effortlessly acquired using multimodal wearable biosensors. This new knowledge will facilitate the application of wearable EDA sensing devices to continuously, less invasively, and less laboriously measure people\'s stress in their daily interactions with the built environment.

Despite such importance, various types of environmental barriers (e.g., steep slopes and uneven sidewalks) have limited their mobility. Recent wearable biosensors have shown the potential to less invasively, less laboriously, and continuously detect environmental barriers by measuring stress in older adults\' daily trips. However, stress alone could not be indicative of environmental barriers because various stress stimuli (e.g., emotions and physical fatigue) are mixed up in their daily trips. To fill this gap, the authors propose and test a computational approach that spatially identifies stress resulting from environmental barriers by aggregating multiple people\'s physiological and location data. The proposed approach measures stress commonly sensed from multiple people in a specific location (collective stress) as an indication of environmental barriers, applying wearable biosensors, signal processing, and geocoding. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, collective stress was compared between locations with and without environmental barriers based on 2 weeks of field data collected from the daily trips of 16 subjects. As a result, the collective stress was statistically higher in the locations with environmental barriers than without. This result shows that the proposed approach is feasible to compute collective stress measures that are indicative of environmental barriers. This finding contributes to the body of knowledge by confirming the feasibility of a new computational approach that understands locational stress-inducing factors by spatially aggregating multiple people\'s physiological signals using wearable biosensors, signal processing, and geocoding.

A waist-worn inertial measurement unit sensor was used to extract features of waist movements, which were mapped into a single value to measure LOB scores using the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. As an individual worker is exposed to STF hazards, the MD values become larger than without exposure to STF hazards.

An automated approach proposed in this study attempts to systematically create the synthetic images using the Unity game engine in which context- and variability-related parameters can be controlled. The proposed method was validated by training a deep learning-based object detection algorithm [i.e., a faster regions with convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model] with synthetic images and testing it on real images from earthwork construction sites to detect an excavator. The CNN models trained with synthetic images showed an average precision value of more than 90%; in particular, the classifier using synthetic images outperformed the one using real site images. The detection results also demonstrated an improved capability to capture the high irregularity of a construction object on images when using techniques of context customization and variability randomization.

Many courts and administrative boards recognize that there is cumulative impact above and beyond the change itself. However, determination of the impact and its cost is difficult due to the interconnected nature of construction work and the difficulty in isolating causal factors and their effects. As a result, it is very difficult for owners and contractors to agree on equitable adjustments for the cumulative impact. What is needed is a reliable method (model) to identify and quantify the loss of productivity caused by the cumulative impact of change orders. A number of studies have attempted to quantify the impact of change orders on the project costs and schedule. Many of these attempted to develop regression models to quantify the loss. However, traditional regression analysis has shortcomings in dealing with highly correlated multivariable data. Moreover, regression analysis has shown limited success when dealing with many qualitative or noisy input factors. Classification and regression tree methods have the ability to deal with these complex multifactor modeling problems. This study develops decision tree models to classify and quantify the labor productivity losses that are caused by the cumulative impact of change orders for electrical and mechanical projects.

Additional methods to implement constraints must be used with these algorithms when solving constrained optimization problems. The purpose of the study is to improve the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm to include constraints. An adaptive penalty function that is easy to implement, free of parameter tuning, and guaranteed to find a solution for every problem at every run was used to impose constraints on the SCE-UA. The modified SCE-UA was validated by application to two constrained optimization problems. The algorithm was also applied to an automatic calibration of the storm water management model (SWMM), which is a hydrological model. An automatic calibration by unconstrained optimization (the original SCE-UA) was not able to properly simulate the observed data. On the other hand, the modified SCE-UA with the adaptive penalty function produced results superior to those obtained using unconstrained optimization. That is the reason why the calibration was advanced to improve the limitation of the unconstrained optimization by imposing constraints. The constrained optimization module modified by embedding the adaptive penalty function could help in solving various constrained optimization problems in the water resources engineering field.

However, major roads in urban areas are generally complicated and have heavy traffic during the daytime, so such field investigation can be significantly limited. Moreover, any road work at nighttime can be risky and dangerous and incur excessive expenses. Based on a review of existing systems for monitoring road conditions, this study focuses on overcoming two unsolved challenges: the capacity of the monitoring range and the avoidance techniques to ensure traffic is not hindered. To solve these challenges, these paper proposes an integrated road monitoring system called Car-free Street Mapping (CfSM) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), aerial mapping cameras, and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The use of the aerial mapping camera mounted on the UAV is to widen the monitoring viewing range, and general-purpose drones are used in this study rather than expensive special equipment. Since the drone-taken images include many passing vehicles that conceal the road surface from the camera vision, the DL model was applied to detect the vehicles and their shadows and then remove them from the images. To train the DL model, two image datasets were used: publicly available cars overhead with context (COWC) images and orthoimages additionally taken for the project to further improve the accuracy. The two datasets consist of 298,623 labeled objects on 9,331 images in total. The tests resulted in a mean average precision (mAP) of 89.57% for trucks, 95.77% for passenger vehicles, and 76.51% for buses. Finally, the object-removed images were composited into one whole car-free image. The CfSM was applied to two areas in Yeouido and Sangam-dong, Seoul, Korea.

During emergencies in the facility management domain, first responders typically search for critical assets, both related to business continuity and value to the organization. This paper presents a formalized approach to reason about building systems and content to support vulnerability assessment in building emergencies caused by failures in building systems (e. g., sprinkler line leak, power outage). The developed reasoning approach enables a first responder to perform flexible searches and prioritize critical spaces and pieces of equipment that need to be protected in an emergency by leveraging existing building and content representations found in building information models (BIM). This approach targets retrieving and prioritizing vulnerable content using a faceted classification-based approach. The faceted-retrieval mechanism was tested for precision and recall in retrieving vulnerable content in two scenarios with ten experts. Results show increased precision and recall (98 and 92%, respectively) when all facets were used in the search. These results demonstrate that the faceted-retrieval mechanism more effectively retrieves content that need to be protected in building emergencies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000214.

The objective of this paper is to identify and investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges, examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future research. These research directions apply to technical issues and sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place, which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry.

The presence of door and window openings in such structures, and covering caused by other elements while performing the measurements, often results in gaps in the observation sets. Because the splines tend to minimize the total curvature, model flattening occurs at the areas without observations, which leads to deformation in the adjoining areas. Spline models in such areas offer, as a rule, insufficient approximation accuracy. The solution of the problem, presented in the paper, involves filling the gaps in an incomplete set of observations with artificially generated pseudo-observations. This will allow reducing surface deformations in the areas adjoining to the immeasurable locations. The kriging method was chosen to perform such task. To verify the effectiveness of the solution proposed, several variants of models were constructed and analyzed afterwards.

In this paper, the support vector machines (SVM) approach is developed for the conditional simulation of non-Gaussian stochastic processes and fields. To show the advantages of the presented method, the conditional simulation of non-Gaussian fluctuating wind pressures is carried out by using SVM and artificial neural networks (ANN). SVM considers three kinds of kernel function, such as linear function, Gaussian radial basis function, and exponential radial basis function, whereas ANN employs back-propagation and generalized regression. In machine learning of these artificial intelligences, two ways (interpolation and extrapolation) are employed to train finite non-Gaussian samples. The feasibility and validity of these algorithms are evaluated through the correlation coefficients, root mean square errors, skewness errors, and kurtosis errors between simulated samples and target samples and probability density functions (PDF), power spectral density (PSD) functions, and autocorrelation functions (ACF) of the simulated non-Gaussian fluctuating wind pressures versus their corresponding targets. The results show that the accuracy and effectiveness of SVM with an appropriate kernel function are superior to the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Furthermore, the advantage of the presented SVM approach is very obvious when the trained non-Gaussian samples are few. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000113.

To overcome this and other limitations, this paper presents a four-phase bounding box-based image-segmentation technique for fully automated crack classification. First, 1 mm three-dimensional (3D) pavement data are continuously collected at high speed using an emerging pavement data collection system, on the basis of which cracks are identified with a multiseed fusion algorithm.

This paper presents a novel method to overcome the two limitations by simultaneously estimating the radius and the buried depth of underground utilities based on GPR scans and auxiliary global positioning system (GPS) data. First, GPR scans are pre-processed to extract raw data points. Thereafter, a generic hyperbola equation is proposed to model GPR raw data, which incorporates the relative angles between buried utilities and GPR scanning trajectories. The very important point (VIP) algorithm then is developed to estimate the radius and depth utilizing auxiliary GPS data. The proposed new method was validated using GPR field scans obtained under various settings and was found to increase the accuracy of estimating the buried depth and radius under a general scanning condition (i.e., when both the EM wave velocity and the range of the radius are unknown and the GPR scanning trajectory is not perpendicular to the centerline of the buried utility).

Accurate and complete information regarding pavement cracks is critical to determining pavement maintenance schedules, methods, and budgets. Two-dimensional (2D) pavement images are used in practice for crack detection and segmentation. Automatic crack detection and segmentation based on 2D images are challenging because of (1) low contrast between cracks and surrounding pavement; (2) complicated patterns of cracks; and (3) intensity inhomogeneity along cracks. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method to automatically detect and segment pavement cracks from 2D images. Specifically, the proposed method starts with the use of a steerable matched filter to generate a crack saliency map, which enhances the contrast between cracks and surrounding pavement and captures crack discontinuity and curvature. Analysis of the crack saliency map leads to a coarse crack region and rough estimates of crack properties. The coarse crack region is then fed into a region-based active contour model, and a level set evolution method is employed to implement the model for crack segmentation. The estimated crack properties provide information to automatically adjust the parameters of the active contour model for effective and efficient crack segmentation.

Modern computational design software enables the rapid creation and exploration of such complex surface geometries for architectural design, but the resulting shapes lack an obvious way for engineers to create a discrete structural grid to support the surface that manifests the architect\'s intent. This paper presents an efficient design approach for the synthesis of free-form grid structures based on guideline and surface-flattening methods, which consider complex features and internal boundaries. The method employs a fast and straightforward approach, which achieves fluent lines with bars of balanced length. The parametric domain of a complete nonuniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surface is first divided into a number of patches, and a discrete free-form surface is formed by mapping dividing points onto the surface. The free-form surface is then flattened based on the principle of equal area. Accordingly, the flattened rectangular lattices are then fit to the two-dimensional (2D) surface, with grids formed by applying a guideline method. Subsequently, the intersections of the guidelines and the complex boundary are obtained, and the guidelines are divided equally between boundaries to produce grids connected at the dividing points. Finally, the 2D grids are mapped back onto the three-dimensional (3D) surface and a spring-mass relaxation method is employed to further improve the smoothness of the resulting grids.

Distributed real-time hybrid simulation (dRTHS) facilitates testing that is to be conducted at multiple geographically distributed laboratories while utilizing the Internet to couple the substructures.

Bridge inventory data [e.g., the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) data] are undoubtedly important but are not enough. They mainly describe bridge conditions using abstract, aggregated condition ratings that do not contain detailed information about bridge deficiencies and maintenance actions, thus limiting the performance of data-driven deterioration prediction and its usefulness in supporting bridge maintenance decision making. Learning from the wealth of heterogeneous (i.e., structured and unstructured) bridge data from multiple sources opens an unprecedented opportunity for enhanced data-driven bridge deterioration prediction. Such data include structured NBI and National Bridge Elements (NBE) data, structured traffic and weather data, and unstructured textual bridge inspection reports. To capitalize on this opportunity, this paper proposes a novel bridge data analytics framework, which allows for the extraction, integration, and analysis of structured and unstructured bridge data from different sources. At the cornerstone of this framework is a proposed deep learning-based bridge deterioration prediction method for analyzing and learning from the integrated bridge data to predict bridge deterioration. The proposed method includes three primary components: manifold learning for embedding the integrated bridge data into a low-dimensional dense space, cost-sensitive learning for modulating the misclassification costs to address the class imbalance in the data, and recurrent neural networks for learning from the embedded and balanced data from past years to predict the conditions of the primary bridge components (decks, superstructures, and substructures) in the next year. The method was evaluated in predicting the condition ratings of the decks, superstructures, and substructures of 2,646 bridges in the state of Washington.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new hybrid data fusion method. It combines an unsupervised named entity normalization method and an entropy-based numerical data fusion method to fuse concept names and numerical data, respectively. The proposed normalization method uses an n-gram model to generate candidate canonical identifier names and utilizes corpus statistics and lexical patterns to fuse the multiple concept names into a candidate name that balances abstraction and detailedness. The proposed fusion method uses data discretization and information entropy to fuse the multiple deficiency measures (of the instances) into a single representation. The hybrid fusion method was validated in fusing data extracted from textual bridge inspection reports for supporting the prediction of future bridge condition ratings.

Second, a traditional reliability analysis is typically confined to static process reasoning, which cannot reflect the time-varying effects of adjacent environments. This study develops a binary discrete time-varying Bayesian copula model for precisely evaluating the structural reliability of operational tunnels to overcome the deficiencies.

Results show that the fitting effect is poorer in the Gaussian copula function than in the Clayton, Gumbel, and Frank copula functions. Convergence deformation (CD) and differential settlement (DS) values present non-Gaussian dependent structures, which indicates that traditional assumptions of the independence or Gaussian-dependent structures were not applicable to this case.

The development of a means for automated assessment employing digital image processing offers high potential for practical implementation. However, two problems in two-dimensional (2D) image processing hinder direct application for crack assessment, as follows: (1) the image used for the digital image processing has to be taken perpendicular to the surface of the concrete structure, and (2) the working distance used in retrieving the imaging model has to be measured each time. To address these problems, this paper proposes a combination of 2D image processing and three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction to locate the 3D position of crack edges. In the proposed algorithm, first the precise crack information is obtained from the 2D images after noise elimination and crack detection using image processing techniques. Then, 3D reconstruction is conducted employing several crack images to build the 3D scene, and the surfaces in the scene are estimated by plane fitting using the 3D point cloud. Subsequently, the crack is projected from the 2D image onto the 3D concrete surface with a crack so that the precise 3D coordinates of the crack edges are found. The final crack assessment results are given using the scaled 3D crack information. Field tests were conducted on a concrete wall including single and multiple concrete surface tests, and a concrete flange with complex crack shape, respectively.

Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers.

This paper focuses on SA for IR for supporting the transportation project environmental review (TPER) decision-making process. It proposes an epistemology-based SA algorithm for automatically annotating Web pages in the TPER domain with contextual concepts from an epistemological model. The TPER epistemology is a semantic model for representing and reasoning about information and IR in the TPER domain. In developing the proposed algorithm, a number of shallow and deep SA algorithms were developed and tested. For the shallow SA algorithms, the effects of syntactic expansion and filtering were investigated. For the deep SA algorithms, different semantic similarity (SS) calculation methods were evaluated. All the algorithms were tested on a data set of 1,328 Web pages, which were collected from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Environmental Review Toolkit Web site, and they were evaluated in terms of mean precision (MP) and mean average precision (MAP). The final, proposed SA algorithm achieved over 91% MP and over 86% MAP at the top 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 documents on the testing data.', 'xuanlv2@illinois.edu; gohary@illinois.edu', '6', '6', '2000-01-01 00:20:16', 30, 6);

The CIP identifies capital projects and is typically funded through several distinct funding sources with specific usage, timing, and reporting restrictions. The continuous nature of capital improvement planning compounded by the potential for scope or funding availability changes further makes it a challenge to retain the flexibility to add new and different funding sources to an existing funding allocation plan. Existing literature about this problem is sparse, and a systemic solution is yet to be proposed that enables an owner organization to meet its goals while maintaining fiscal responsibility toward its funding agencies. The financial digital twin (FinDT) framework developed in this study integrates fund allocation and accounting with project acquisition in real time and enables the owner to automate funding allocation tasks and to synchronize change management while ensuring compliance with funding restrictions. The goal of this framework is to leverage rule-based knowledge management to consolidate and continually optimize the efficient use of accurate financial information at all stages of the capital asset lifecycle. This is accomplished through automation and digital twin (DT) integration. A use case was developed to demonstrate and evaluate the FinDT, which was found to hold potential for more efficient information management and support for decision making through enterprise-level data integration.

In this paper, an accurate and efficient framework is proposed for automated detection of obstacles restricting sight distance on highways using mobile laser scanning (MLS) data. The developed framework was implemented in MATLAB (version: 2020a) and operates along the mapping trajectory recorded in the MLS data. A linear index-based segmentation technique was used to efficiently segment MLS point clouds; based on this, methods for identifying target points, removing on-road noise, and detecting sight obstacles were then developed. The target points for sight obstacle detection were derived from the pavement surface points, which were identified via a similarity-and-connectivity-based technique. Considering that on-road vehicle noise may adversely affect the detection of sight obstructions, a data-refinement procedure was developed to remove them and to fill the missing point regions they caused. For each sight point in the mapping trajectory, a segmentation-based algorithm was applied to achieve fast sight obstacle detection. Tests on MLS data from two real-world highways in the case study showed that the proposed framework detected sight obstructions on the combined highway alignments in the presence of noise. The procedure detected sight obstacles at each sight point within 0.2 s, with limited computational power.

Furthermore, for distresses that degrade the classification performance of the tag-based Bayesian network model, the proposed method trains another multifeature Bayesian network model based on inspection items and distress images. Consequently, the proposed method can adaptively select optimal Bayesian network models according to the estimated performance of the tag-based Bayesian network model. In actual maintenance inspection, distresses are generally classified either from inspection items alone or from both inspection items and visual information of distress images-i.e., distress classification has two patterns.

The majority of construction disputes are resolved in courts unless project contracts call for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the numerous advantages offered by the litigation process, the extra financial burdens and additional time required by this process makes litigation less desirable in resolving the disputes of a very dynamic construction industry. It is believed that construction litigation could be reduced or even avoided if parties have a realistic understanding of their actual legal position and the likely outcome of their case. Consequently, researchers in the artificial intelligence field have developed tools and methodologies for modeling judicial reasoning and predicting the outcomes of construction litigation cases.

Despite significant technological advances in the last few decades, people with physical disabilities who rely on wheeled mobility devices continue to face significant challenges when independently navigating inside complex indoor environments. Several technological solutions have been explored to address this issue in previous work. Specifically, vision-based techniques that utilize fiducial markers as visual cues for assisted navigation have received particular attention because of their cost-effectiveness, reconfigurability, and ease of installation. Although such previous work addressed indoor localization for assisted navigation, it did not adequately address the fundamental aspects of indoor path planning, particularly in the context of considering human preferences or physical constraints present in the built environment. This paper addresses these key research gaps by developing fundamental rules for creating an indoor attribute-loaded graph network and a marker network map, developing a generic algorithm for determining optimal paths (instead of shortest paths only) from attribute-loaded networks, and integrating the findings within an interactive user interface (UI).

The enormous progress of scientific computation and data-mining techniques has allowed the search for accurate mathematical models from experimental data using algorithms. Among them, the evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that merges genetic algorithms (GAs) and regression techniques such as ordinary least square (OLS). This paper presents a robust and well-conditioned EPR technique to remove potential outliers and leverage points included in any biased data set. This hybrid approach combines bisquare, Huber, and Cauchy robust multivariate techniques with GAs and the Akaike weight-based method to assess the optimal polynomial model while limiting the impact of the data bias. The robust techniques will define the parameters, the GAs will determine the exponents, and the Akaike weight-based method will evaluate the relative importance of each observed variable of the proposed model. As a case study, a shear strength data set of RC beams without stirrups is used to compare the standard EPR algorithm with the new proposed hybrid methodology. Furthermore, the optimal robust model is compared with different benchmark formulations to highlight its accuracy and consistency. The proposed hybrid technique can be adopted as a mathematical tool for many engineering problems, providing an unbiased prediction of the observed variable.

Fuzzy uncertainties arise because of imprecise understanding and subsequent representation of these uncertainties by the decision maker, whereas random uncertainties arise from variance of these imprecisions. Since there are no well-defined rules for spontaneous decisions, in order to be consistently confident in the appropriateness of the chosen delivery method, a structured approach incorporating uncertainty is required. Previously unanswered questions such as (1) what are the sources of uncertainty in project delivery decisions, (2) how do decision makers conceptualize uncertainties, and (3) how the use of existing models increase or decrease uncertainty, were investigated. The answer to these questions revealed that while fuzziness has been accounted for in present procurement theory, the modeling of randomness has been neglected. Therefore, a forward normal cloud model that uses a normal distribution membership function was built to rank decision makers\' preferences. This proposed approach provides a better conceptualization of project delivery decision making, and is shown to be more sensitive in distinguishing alternatives compared on factors, than the interval analytical hierarchy process (AHP) rough-set approach. Survey results showed statistical significance (p < 0.05) for the model\'s reliability in choosing the preferred delivery method. Overall, construction decision makers can be confident that conflicting project outcomes will less likely result from their recommendations as the proposed cloud model enables clients to perform quantitative calculations incorporating a wider spectrum of uncertainties in their decision.

This approach optimises the use of resources at different locations to achieve a more representative experiment. While different software to conduct distributed simulations exists, there are no standards and specifications to organise and plan the experiments, and as a result the different systems lack inter-operability. To address these issues, we have developed a high-level specification called Celestina, which provides a framework for conducting a distributed experiment. Celestina specifies the services to be implemented, under three main headings of networking, definition and execution, and supports the data exchange during a simulation. It does not force any particular implementation or method of data exchange. This paper summarises the Celestina specification and describes one implementation. Lastly, a validation experiment is presented, involving distributed numerical simulations of an earlier local hybrid experiment, in which Celestina controls the experiment planning and data exchange effectively and with minimal computational overhead.

The former deals with longitudinal movement behavior, while the latter deals with lateral movement behavior. However, typical heterogeneous traffic is characterized by the presence of multiple vehicle types and non-lane-based movement. Because of the off-centered positions of the vehicles, the following driver is not necessarily influenced by a single leader. Additionally, the following behavior of the subject vehicle depends on the type of the front vehicle. Unlike discrete lane changes in the case of lane-based traffic, heterogeneous traffic streams require modeling of continuous lateral movements. Hence, the existing driver behavioral models may not be able to represent the heterogeneous traffic behavior accurately enough. To address these critical issues of heterogeneous traffic, a space discretization-based simulation framework is proposed. The lane is divided into strips and the vehicles are assumed to move along the strips. A vehicle may occupy a multiple number of strips governed by its width. A model for longitudinal movement is proposed to take account for the multiple leader and vehicle-type dependent following behavior. The lateral movement model allows tactical overtaking maneuvers by a vehicle (in anticipation of better traffic conditions), which may require multiple strip changes. Thus, continuous lateral movement can be modeled by defining very small strip widths. On the other hand, the proposed simulation framework retains the concept of lane-based movement when the strip width equals the lane width and can be used even for the traditional lane-based traffic streams. The same concept was extended to model the vehicular movements at and within the intersection. The proposed framework, termed SiMTraM, is implemented in a traditional lane-based simulator, SUMO, an open-source traffic simulator. The model was calibrated and validated with data from Mumbai, India, and the results indicate better representation of the mixed traffic movement.

Based on the case study, the proposed framework was able to reduce the computation time by 90.5%, achieve a speedup of 2, improve the hypervolume indicator by 3.44%, and increase the confidence level by at least 100%.

Third, the effects of wander and multilane effects in estimating the minimum required sample size for RQI measurements to converge were evaluated.

Among the life cycle costs of wind farms, operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts for 25-30%, and an efficient strategy for management of turbines can significantly reduce the O&M cost. Wind turbines are subject to fatigue-induced degradation and need periodic inspections and repairs, which are usually performed through semiannual scheduled maintenance. However, better maintenance can be achieved by flexible policies based on prior knowledge of the degradation process and on data collected in the field by sensors and visual inspections. Traditional methods to model the O&M process, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), have limitations that do not allow the model to properly include the knowledge available and that may result in nonoptimal strategies for management of the farm. Specifically, the conditional probabilities for modeling the degradation process and the precision of the observations are usually affected by epistemic uncertainty. Although MDPs and POMDPs are formulated for fixed transition and emission probabilities, the Bayes-adaptive POMDP (BA-POMDP) framework treats those conditional probabilities as random variables and is therefore suitable for including epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, a novel learning and planning method is proposed, called planning and learning in uncertain dynamic systems (PLUS), within the BA-POMDP framework that can learn from the environment, update the distributions of model parameters, and select the optimal strategy considering the uncertainty related to the model. Validating with synthetic data, the total management cost of a wind farm using PLUS is shown to be significantly less than costs achieved by a fixed policy or through the POMDP framework.

Accurate recognition of these changes is critical for effectively understanding the construction status; however, recognizing the various levels of detailed material conditions is not sufficiently explored. The primary challenge in the detailed recognition of the conditions of the material is the availability of labeled training data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel state-of-the-art deep learning model that leverages transfer learning, utilizing the pretrained Inception V3 to transfer knowledge to the limited labeled data set in the construction context. This enables the model to learn meaningful representations from the limited training data, enhancing its ability to accurately classify material conditions. In addition, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture features are extracted from the images to capture the appearance and textural changes in construction materials, which are then concatenated with the transferred convolutional neural network (CNN) features to create a more comprehensive representation of the material conditions. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 95% and 71% with limited (208 images) and very small (70 images) data sets, respectively. It outperformed different experimental architectures, including CNN models developed using limited data with and without augmentation, CNN model with data augmentation and transfer learning, separate models using local binary pattern (LBP) and GLCM texture features with super learners trained using augmented limited data. The findings suggest that the proposed model, which combines transfer learning with GLCM-based texture features, is effective in accurately recognizing the conditions of construction materials, even with limited labeled training data. This can contribute to improved construction management and monitoring. There are several practical applications of the proposed model combining CNN architecture with GLCM textures in construction industry. The primary applications are in activities such as quality inspection and progress monitoring. By analyzing images of different material conditions, such as concrete, plaster, or masonry walls, the model can be used to automatically detect defects or inconsistencies. This enables construction practitioners to ensure the quality of their structures, detect issues early on, and make informed decisions for maintenance and repair. Additionally, the model can be used to monitor the progress of construction projects by analyzing images to track the status and completion of different building components to estimate delays or cost overruns comparing with the expected material condition at a given time of the schedule.

Civil engineers must stay informed of GIS issues and progress, but more importantly, civil engineers must inform the GIS community to direct the technology development optimally.', '', '34', '44', '2000-01-01 00:19:00', 13, 3);

Effective and timely decision making during this period requires a comprehensive knowledge about the current state of the building and an ability to compare the probable outcomes of each evacuation strategy.

In this paper, a decision-support system is proposed that offers evacuation strategies for fire scenarios as a function of building layout, location and mobility of the hazardous fire products, and route selection of the building population. In the pre-event stage, the system simulates many fire scenarios to evaluate the time and risk associated with various evacuation strategies. When an emergency is identified in real time, the system matches the event with the nearest simulated scenario and selects the corresponding safest evacuation strategy. The optimal strategy is then communicated with the path planning guidance system to direct the movements of the crowd toward the safest exit route. The guidance system simulated here is based on a technology called the Active Dynamic Signage System (ADSS). These signs can change their directional message or dissuade occupants from taking an untenable route.

A common approach undertaken to solve such problems is the simulation-optimization approach where simulation models are coupled with optimization or search methods. Simulation-optimization approaches, particularly in environmental characterization involving natural systems, are computationally expensive due to the complex three-dimensional simulation models required to represent these systems and the large number of such simulations involved. Emerging grid computing environments (e.g., TeraGrid) show promise for improving the computational tractability of these approaches. However, harnessing grid resources for most computational applications is a nontrivial problem due to the complex hierarchy of heterogeneous and geographically distributed resources involved in a grid. This paper reports and discusses the development and evaluation of a grid-enabled simulation-optimization framework for solving environmental characterization problems. The framework is designed in a modular fashion that simplifies coupling with simulation model executables, allowing application of simulation-optimization approaches across problem domains. The framework architecture utilizes standard communications protocols and the message passing interface with an application programming interface to establish a connection between a centralized search application and simulation models running on TeraGrid resources.

Using actuated traffic control as one of the traffic-controlling systems can cause fewer delays for transportation users, specifically when it comes to an isolated intersection. Although actuated signal control has many benefits, the prediction of cycle length is cumbersome because it varies from time to time. The value of signal cycle length in actuated control depends on many parameters. In this research, the authors attempted to understand whether any dependence existed between the current value of the cycle length and its previous values. To capture the dependence among cycle length data, time series analysis was applied over the data, which were obtained from the simulated fully actuated signal. The behavior of the signal\'s cycle length under different levels of demand was analyzed, and, based on sample autocorrelation functions (ACFs), a well-known family of time series called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) was chosen for model fitting and prediction. The results revealed that there is a statistically significant dependence between two consecutive cycle lengths, and this dependence becomes more pronounced as the demand increases. Further, to improve the fit and prediction accuracy of cycle length for signals with more than two critical phases, a linear regression component using skipping indicators has been added to the ARIMA model.

However, a review of available literature suggests that most of the existing vision-based inspection techniques rely only on color information, due to the immediate availability of inexpensive high-resolution cameras. Regular cameras translate a 3D scene to a 2D space, which leads to a loss of information vis-a-vis distance and scale. This imposes a barrier to the realization of the full potential of vision-based techniques. In this regard, the structural health monitoring community is yet to benefit from the new opportunities that commercially-available low-cost depth sensors offer. This study aims at filling this knowledge gap by incorporating depth fusion into an encoder-decoder-based semantic segmentation model. Advanced computer graphics approaches are exploited to generate a database of paired RGB and depth images representing various damage categories that are commonly observed in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, namely, spalling, spalling with exposed rebars, and severely buckled rebars. A number of encoding techniques are explored for representing the depth data. Additionally, various schemes for the data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusions of RGB and depth data are investigated to identify the best fusion strategy. Overall, it was observed that feature-level fusion is the most effective and can enhance the performance of deep learning-based damage segmentation algorithms by up to 25% without any appreciable increase in the computation time. Moreover, a novel volumetric damage quantification approach is introduced, which is robust against perspective distortion. This study is believed to advance the frontiers of infrastructure resilience and maintenance.', 'tg5qf@mst.edu', '1', '1', '2000-01-01 00:20:23', 37, 4);

The approach is the first to use a finite-element (FE) model to predict the failure load, account for load recovery due to friction in broken wires, and simulate the reduced strength of the cable as a three-dimensional random field. To obtain cable failure load, the load is increased gradually, causing individual wires break according to their residual strength variability. Because of the load transfer to surrounding wires, the breakage of an individual wire affects the stress state of its surrounding wires. Consequently, as the load is increased, this local damage spreads to its immediate vicinity, and eventually the entire cable fails. Because of the complexity of the problem, the critical failure load is determined through a Monte Carlo simulation approach that accounts for the uncertainty in the spatial variability of the residual strength of the individual wires.

The main concerns associated with the optimization of WDNs are related to the nonlinearity of the discharge-head loss relationships for pipes and the discrete nature of pipe sizes. This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm, called fittest individual referenced differential evolution (FDE), which is significantly more efficient and reliable than other algorithms for optimization of WDN designs. The fundamental structure of FDE is similar to conventional differential evolution (DE), although the functions of the mutation and crossover operators are to exploit good solutions, and explore very different solutions, respectively, and counting and restarting mechanisms are introduced to identify and avoid local optima. These features are beneficial in WDN design because such problems may have an array of local optima that are far from one another, making finding the global optima difficult. The mutation and crossover operators are developed to accelerate convergence and, although the optimal mutation and crossover parameters may vary among networks, the efficiency of the algorithm reduces the need for adaptive parameters or population size. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for algorithm parameters, as well as counting and restarting limits, based on eight evolutionary algorithm (EA) benchmark test problems, and the efficiency of the FDE for solving 2- and 10-dimensional versions of these problems is demonstrated using the most effective values of the parameters and limits. FDE-based optimal designs of four benchmark networks-the Two-loop, Hanoi, and New York WDNs and the Balerma Irrigation Network-show that on average, a minimal number of function evaluations (or hydraulic simulations) is required to reach the best known optimum, which is less than or equal to 600 in all cases for the first three networks.

Using the agent-based technique, this model simulates the microbehaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Using the output of the simulation model, financing landscapes of the U.S. transportation infrastructure are developed. The simulated landscape is shown to be helpful in identifying the highly likely scenarios leading to a high level of investment in highway transportation infrastructure under the existing infrastructure investment structures and budget constraints in the United States. The study presented in this paper is novel with respect to (1)the application of the system-of-systems modeling in the analysis of transportation infrastructure financing policies, (2)identification of the desired policy scenarios and their likelihoods for closure of the financing gap in the presence of uncertainties and adaptive behaviors, and (3)simulation and visualization of the impacts of financing policies at the state and national levels. The model promotes a data-driven policy analysis and provides policymakers with a tool to simultaneously account for the impacts of several factors and uncertainties.

The proposed SBL-CE algorithm introduces sophisticated hyperparameterization on the regression parameter vector in the ground motion prediction model, aiming to conduct a continuous optimal model search even when the number of extracted features is large.

The feature ontology generically represents construction-specific information that is useful for a broad range of construction management functions.

The camera is installed at the height of the over-height plane formed by the average of the maximum allowable heights across all lanes in a given traffic direction; the error caused by the road gradient is assumed to be negligible and absorbed through the calibration process. At that height, the over-height plane can be safely approximated as a line in the camera view. Any vehicle exceeding this line is consequently over-height. The camera position and orientation are determined through a calibration process proposed. Instances of over-height vehicles are detected through optical flow monitoring.

Conflicting and redundant constraints hence should be determined in the prescheduling stage to enhance scheduling feasibility and efficiency. In this regard, a constraint integration reasoning framework is developed to identify primary and secondary conflicts and redundancies in schedule constraints. The framework comprises sets of rules for the inference of these conditions within each activity or between two activities. It also computes the feasible range of activity durations, which will be useful for planners in modifying and updating schedules.

Measuring this complex motion by traditional, contact-type displacement sensors is challenging. Owing to recent advances in video capture sensors and image processing techniques, vision-based motion tracking and measurement have been introduced as a practical, economical, and fairly accurate measuring method. This paper presents a procedure utilized to evaluate the accuracy of a consumer-grade camera for the purpose of measuring the motion of a piece of medical equipment during shake-table testing. The fixed-focal length camera considered in this study can capture video recordings with different resolution and frame rates. During experimental testing, the camera is positioned at a distance from the target (as it would be in a real application) to track the motion of four LED lights attached to the shake table. The capabilities of the camera are evaluated using as input a signal with varying frequency and amplitude. A wavelet approach is proposed and utilized in order to synchronize the vision-based displacement measurement with the output of the displacement transducer installed on the shake table, to be later used in accuracy assessments. Absolute and relative error curves are presented to evaluate the errors in the frequency range of interest for the actual experiments.

The multiquadric (MQ) function was used to discretize the seepage governing partial differential equation and related boundary conditions. The function contains a shape coefficient of c, which plays an important role in model calibration. Therefore, the coefficient of c was first optimized via Hardy and cross validation methods, and then, by employing the optimal c (c(opt)), two scenarios of modeling with and without considering the internal conditions were provided and the results were compared with the results of the finite difference method (FDM). In the next step, an artificial neural network was used for handling the nonlinear time variability of the phenomenon to cope with the limitations of the FDM and RBF methods in temporal modeling. Thus, by training neural networks for the piezometers located in the core, the potential time series of water were predicted and their results were imposed upon the RBF method as the internal conditions, along with the boundary conditions for spatial-temporal modeling of the water heads. Finally, the assumed time-invariant inherency of c was confirmed by the cross-validation method.

A framework is proposed based on network science, computational science, and multivariate statistics to help planners train a model that can evaluate various alternatives efficiently. This model saves significant time and computational resources. The trained model takes structural and dynamic attributes as inputs and promptly returns macroscopic performance measures such as the averages and standard deviations of speed and volume over capacity.

Nonlinear guided waves are promising candidates for interrogating long waveguide-like structures as they conveniently combine high sensitivity to peculiar structural conditions (defects, quasi-static loads, instability conditions), typical of nonlinear parameters, with large inspection ranges, characteristic of wave propagation in confined media. However, the mathematical framework governing the nonlinear guided wave phenomena becomes extremely difficult when characterized to waveguides that are complex in either material (damping, anisotropy, heterogeneous, and the like) or geometry (multilayers, geometric periodicity, and the like). Therefore, the successful use of nonlinear guided waves as a structural diagnostic tool is not always a trivial task. In particular, the efficiency of nonlinear structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques based on higher-harmonics generation (harmonics generated by a monochromatic input in nonlinear waveguides) strongly relies on the correct identification of favorable combinations of primary and resonant double-harmonic nonlinear wave modes for which the nonlinear response is cumulative. The present work develops predictions of nonlinear second-harmonic generation and identifies these combinations of wave modes in complex waveguides by extending the classical semianalytical finite-element formulation to the nonlinear regime, and implementing it into a highly flexible, yet very powerful, commercial finite-element code. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked for four case studies, including a railroad track, a viscoelastic plate, a composite quasi-isotropic laminate, and a reinforced concrete slab. In all these cases, this tool successfully identified appropriate combinations of resonant guided modes (satisfying synchronism and large cross-energy transfer).

Communication in this approach comprises speech acts whose meaning can be described in terms of the mental states of an agent. This interaction protocol makes it difficult for agents that have been implemented using different approaches to communicate. This paper reviews the potential for addressing this limitation through using organization-centered multi-agent systems (OCMAS) in which agent interaction is designed around macro-level concepts such as organizations, groups, communities, and roles.

Generating accurate three-dimensional (3D) models of buildings is currently considered as a time-consuming, semimanual, and expensive process. However, building models with a low level of details can be created through an automated process rather inexpensively and be used for a variety of purposes, such as virtual urban modeling, predisaster planning, and postdisaster recovery studies. This paper presents an automated method for generating mock-up 3D models of buildings using ground-based images. Rectified images of building facades along with their two-dimensional (2D) footprint were used to create 3D models of buildings with dimension errors less than 40 cm. The method uses the gradient profile of images to predict the locations of the common facade architectural elements (i.e., windows and doors). These locations are then used to extract pixel- and texton-level local and global features to classify the facade elements. The layout of the elements is used as an input to develop a split grammar for the facade. Ultimately, the grammar is used to reconstruct the structure of the facade and to generate the mock-up model. A public facade image database as well as three case study buildings are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results indicated an overall average accuracy of 80.48% in classifying the architectural elements. The proposed method is neither dependent on large-scale labeled ground-truth data nor requires hours for training classifiers. In addition, it has the potential to be scaled up and applied to buildings with a repetitive facade structure.

Typically, interdependence effects (IE) are measured in terms of common failure fractions (f) of components across systems. In this paper, an expanded damage space is explored where infrastructure systems can simultaneously experience different failure fractions f. This augmented space is then mapped onto a functionality space where IEs are evaluated as a function of the efficiencies of constitutive systems: a desirable feature because efficiency is typically measured and recorded in practice whereas f is not. These new IEs conditioned on efficiency levels are termed generalized interdependent effects (GIE), which can be predicted or detected in a computationally efficient fashion. Prediction is a function of initial efficiencies before damage propagation and can be used in prefailure analyses, whereas detection is a function of final joint efficiencies for postfailure analyses. To illustrate the quantification of the nonnegative GIE metric, this study uses artificial power (p) and gas (g) networks with flow traversal capabilities. Results show that the maximum predicted or detected GIE of power on gas and gas on power among all efficiencies are GIE(p -> g)(max) = 1.54 and GIE(p -> g)(max) = 0.19, respectively, highlighting the relative inadequacy of the gas system to function independently (high GIE) and vice versa. The proposed practical metric is expected to provide useful information to infrastructure decision makers on strategies to design interdependent topology and handle interdependencies when operating at different regimes.

Interpreting monitoring information in the presence of multiple uncertainty sources and systematic bias using a physics-based model is a computationally expensive task. The computational cost of this task is exponentially proportional to the number of model parameters updated using monitoring data. In this paper, a novel model-class selection method is proposed to obtain computationally optimal and identifiable model classes. Unlike traditional sensitivity methods for model-class selection, in the proposed method, model responses at sensor locations are clustered to identify underlying trends in model response datasets. K-means clustering is used to determine relevant clusters in the data. Cluster indices are then used as labels for classification. Support-vector machine classification using forward variable selection with sequential search is used to select model parameters that help classify trends in data. The result of the sequential search is a trade-off curve comparing classification error with number of parameters in the model class. This curve helps select a practical and near-optimal model class. The model-class selection method proposed in this paper is compared with linear regression-based sensitivity analysis using a full-scale bridge. Identification with model classes obtained using both methods for two sensor configurations suggests that the model-based clustering method helps select an identifiable and computationally efficient model class. The minimum remaining fatigue life of the bridge predicted using the updated model classes is 720 years and this represents fatigue-life extension of 10 times compared with design predictions prior to measurements. This approach provides good support for asset managers when they interpret measurement data.

Knowledge of the wind flow around buildings can help address these issues through improving natural ventilation, energy use, and outdoor thermal comfort. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are widely used to predict wind flow around buildings, despite the large discrepancies that often occur between model predictions and actual measurements. Wind speed and direction exhibit a high degree of variability that adds uncertainties in modeling and measurements. Although some studies focus on methods to evaluate and minimize modeling uncertainties, sensor placement has been mostly based on subjective judgment and intuition; no systematic methodology is available to identify optimal sensor locations prior to field measurement. This work proposes a methodology for systematic sensor placement for situations when no measurement data are available and knowledge of the wind environment around buildings is limited. Sequential sensor placement algorithms and criteria are used to identify sensor configurations based on CFD simulation predictions at plausible locations. Optimal sensor configurations are compared for their ability to improve wind speed predictions at another location where no measurements are taken. The methodology is applied to two full-scale building systems of varying size. Results show that the methodology can be applied prior to field measurement to identify optimal configurations of a limited number of sensors that improve wind speed predictions at unmeasured locations.

A video camera was used to monitor their motion within a specified area of view. The resulting video record was converted to digital images using a frame grabber. These digital images were downloaded to a workstation for analysis. The outcome of this analysis provided quantitative information about the frequency of the entrainment of the glass beads, their displacement distance, and the mode of their motion. Such information, when used in conjunction with laser Doppler velocimeter measurements of the fluid velocity, can elucidate the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the entrainment of sediment. During the analysis of the tests, it was observed that the displacement of the beads was sporadic and occurred typically by rolling. The glass beads moved predominately along the flow direction, while on some occasions they were displaced in the transverse direction. For the two packing density tests that were examined, the minimum traveling distance in the longitudinal direction was found to be equal to one bead diameter and the maximum was equal to 10 bead diameters.

They provide the location of a large number of entities in a camera view across frames. However, vision trackers provide only two-dimensional (2D) pixel coordinates, which are not adequate for construction applications. This paper proposes and validates a method that overcomes this limitation by employing stereo cameras and converting 2D pixel coordinates to three-dimensional (3D) metric coordinates. The proposed method consists of four steps: camera calibration, camera pose estimation, 2D tracking, and triangulation. Given that the method employs fixed, calibrated stereo cameras with a long baseline, appropriate algorithms are selected for each step. Once the first two steps reveal camera system parameters, the third step determines 2D pixel coordinates of entities in subsequent frames. The 2D coordinates are triangulated on the basis of the camera system parameters to obtain 3D coordinates.

Both cost terms are interrelated because a trade-off exists between maintaining pumps frequently (with increased pump efficiency, reduced energy costs and increasing maintenance costs, and pump unavailability) and extending the intervals between the overhauls (increased loss of efficiency, increased energy costs, and decreased maintenance costs). The planner needs to forecast pump overhaul demands to determine budget levels because economic resources are limited. This process is assisted by using mathematical programming methods to prioritize funding for equipment requiring renewal in consideration of limited resources in a strategic time horizon (several years). This work proposes an efficient model to define an overhaul maintenance program for a pump network with a large number of pumps (a few hundred in the case study). The model minimizes the discounted total (energy+overhaul) cost by selecting and scheduling pumps for overhaul subject to budget constraints. The formulation uses 0-1 integer programming.

STOCH-MPEC problems can be computationally intractable, if the number of scenarios is large and/or the study network is large-scale. To reduce the associated complexity of FNDP, we develop a sample average approximate method (SAA) to efficiently solve the flexible network design problem.

The optimizations include removal of explicit synchronization mechanisms (Level 1) and conversion of blocking to nonblocking communications (Level 2). Our findings show that Level 1 always improves speed-up over Level 0, while the effectiveness of Level 2 over Level 1 is mixed. Level 2 results in the best performance on a system with a relatively small bandwidth (100 Mb) interconnect switch, but in a few cases involving a system with a gigabit interconnect switch, Level 2 actually leads to slow-down as compared to Level 1. Level 2 was found to be more difficult to implement than Level 1, and the resulting code was less modular and more difficult to read. Overall, the marginal performance improvements of nonblocking communications (Level 2) cannot justify the effort to realize the optimization and the cost of a less readable program. In the context of algorithm development, we emphasize delaying optimizations until a correct parallel implementation has been obtained.

In the proposed approach, safety scenarios predicted by the simulation model are compared with historical cases within a database to assess safety performance. Then, the simulation model, which combines discrete and continuous simulation to replicate the life cycle of the project, is used to update safety-related measures at specified time intervals.

However, several current ramp metering algorithms tend to optimize only freeway travels using local detectors\' inputs and overlook the negative impacts on local streets. This may generate two problems: (1)the optimal local settings may not result in a system-wide optimum in terms of traffic operations; and (2)the increased congestion on local streets due to on-ramp overflow may counteract the gains in freeway operations. To solve these problems for nonrecurrent cases, we propose an area-wide ramp metering (AIMD) system to coordinate the previously isolated ramp meters for system-wide optimization. This novel strategy for active ramp metering is inspired by the principles of a computer network congestion control algorithm. In this strategy, certain types of congestion at a targeted freeway location can be significantly reduced by limiting vehicle flows on each ramp to a fraction of ramp demand and then additively increasing rates to avoid ramp queue spillover onto city streets. This approach can be actively used to proactively curb the growth of traffic congestion and therefore shorten travel delays. Six simulated scenarios using this strategy are shown to significantly reduce vehicle delays in various zones when compared to two other strategies: the Fuzzy Logic strategy employed by the Washington State DOT, and the performance of no ramp meter control. Based on the Tukey statistical testing method, the overall improvement of AIMD is shown to be significant.

Thus, early identification and intervention of potential risks in contracts play significant roles in preventing conflicts in advance. However, traditional approaches are mostly limited to the simple task of predicting fragmentary information (e.g., a type of risk) from contracts. This study aims to predict comprehensive information to determine risk-handling actions by simultaneously performing three classification tasks (i.e., risk identification, risk allocation, and risk response). Specifically, the proposed multitask model is designed to integrate shared layers extracting general features for all three tasks with task-specific layers extracting relevant features of each individual task. Thus, this approach allows learning both common and specific features within a single network. For performance evaluation, experiments were performed on a data set of 2,586 contractual clauses from 10 construction projects, in which performance was compared with single-task models not only on the entire data set but also on the smaller number of data. The results revealed that the proposed model exhibited higher performance (mean weighted F1 score of 0.90 and accuracy of 0.78) than single-task models; furthermore, shared layers may better recognize hidden patterns for each classification task with the smaller data set (e.g., 0.04 higher mean F1 score and 0.09 higher accuracy for 250 samples). Thus, the proposed model can successfully implement three tasks simultaneously.

A frequently encountered transportation problem is the shortest path problem; that is, finding the shortest path between any two nodes in a transportation network. For the large transportation networks encountered in major metropolitan areas, this problem can be computationally demanding, especially if shortest paths between all the nodes in the network need to be dynamically updated (e. g., evolving traffic conditions). In such a situation, one may wish to harness parallel computing to solve this problem. However, the parallel implementations of commonly used shortest-path algorithms are computationally demanding because of the inherent sequential nature of the search process used by the algorithms. This paper describes parallel implementations and includes performance analyses of two prominent graph algorithms (i.e., Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra) used for finding the all-pairs shortest path for a large-scale transportation network.

This paper proposes an integrated, infrastructure management information system as a reliable and effective alternative. Issues related to sharing data, customizing applications, supporting multiple data formats, querying visually, facilitating ubiquitous computing, and upgrading are all addressed. Achieving maximum flexibility and capacity in a disaster management system relies upon recent advances in the following areas: (1) standardized data specifications; (2) middleware services; and (3) Web-enabled, distributed computing. Key resources in designing and implementing such an arrangement are prototyped in a system that was initially designed for addressing disaster management of urban explosions. The critical details of that system are presented herein.', 'debra.laefer@ucd.ie', '44', '50', '2000-01-01 00:20:07', 21, 2);

The criterion analyses condition data sets by simultaneously identifying optimum trends in condition progression, the position in time and space of maintenance interventions, longitudinal segments within links, and the error likelihood of each measurement. This is done in an unsupervised manner through classification and regression models on the basis of the minimum message length (MML) metric. Use of MML, however, often requires an exhaustive comparison of all possible models, which naturally raises considerable search-control issues. This is precisely the case with the MML2DS approach. This paper presents an efficient meta-analytic framework for controlling the generation of progression groups, which considerably reduces the search space before the application of MML2DS. This is achieved by identifying founder sets of longitudinal segments, around which families of segments are likely to be formed. An effective subset of these families is then selected, after which the MML2DS criterion is used as the final arbiter to determine ultimate model configurations and fits. This approach has proved to be very powerful, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency to the effect that accurate results are obtained in a few minutes where it previously took weeks with much smaller data sets. The indications are that this approach can be applied to other techniques besides MML2DS.

Well-known methodologies, such as traditional implementations of Bayesian model updating, have been shown to be inaccurate in cases characterized by systematic uncertainties and unknown spatial correlations. Error-domain model falsification (EDMF) is another approach to structural identification. This approach is easy to understand for practicing engineers and can provide robust parameter identification without assumptions on spatial correlations. The performance of all approaches involving sampling is affected by the number of model evaluations that is generated based on prior knowledge of parameter-value distributions. This paper focuses on a new sampling technique, called radial-basis function sampling (RBFS), and its application to EDMF, to generate a set of candidate models that represents the behavior of the structure with a certain confidence level. Radial-basis function sampling provides a good exploration of the parameter space even with a limited number of samples, which results in reduced computation times. A full-scale bridge in Singapore has been tested and a new index of sampling quality is proposed to compare this approach with other sampling techniques such as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Finally, a cross-validation method is used to verify the robustness of the approach and the sensitivity of sampling on prediction reliability.

Whereas many factors may contribute to this statistic, one likely cause is due to designers who often lack design for construction safety knowledge, which results in many safety hazards being built into project designs. Therefore, there is a compelling need for tools that can put the safety-in-design concept into practice. To improve the current situation, a prevention through design (PTD) tool based on computer software was developed. Construction safety best practices were compiled into computable rules so that the PTD tool can automatically conduct compliance checking. Particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents since falls are the most frequently occurring cause of fatalities on construction sites. This tool efficiently makes PTD suggestions available to designers and constructors. With this PTD tool, it is possible for project participants to work together to optimize building designs for construction worker safety, which provides valuable downstream benefits. By using the results of the safety check by this PTD tool, constructors have the opportunity to plan for preliminary safety measures to address construction site hazards from the beginning of the project. Preplanning facilitates reduction of potential hazards on construction sites by allowing for consideration of construction worker safety during the design and preconstruction phases of a project.

In recent years, accurate cracking map can be derived in a consistent manner with the advance of the three-dimensional (3D) data collection systems. Nonetheless, rare effort has been dedicated to rigorous cracking length and width measurement, which has slowed the progress of cracking measurement.

By using these two boundary point groups, multimodel fitting is used for the estimation of the horizontal and vertical alignments based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, and the final alignments are determined using a global optimization based on piecewise fitting.

The present study aims to develop a computationally efficient traffic flow simulation model integrating the concepts of cellular automata and driver-vehicle-objects, thus making a behavioral model of traffic. The model emphasizes the diversity in human behavior, and represents the traffic using the minimal modeling concept of CA. To represent multiple vehicle types, a multicell representation was adopted. Further, to address the issue of nonlane-based movement, new lateral movement rules were proposed. The model incorporated behavior at amber and lateral movements, thus attempting to achieve a near to reality representation of nonlane-based heterogeneous traffic.

Conventional methods of producing a single design solution and the use of optimization methods to find a single global optimum solution is not what practicing engineers require. This paper introduces an innovative approach to design, which emphasizes the interactive use of evolutionary computing in design and a new approach to visualization of search and solution spaces. This replaces the \'\' black box \'\' nature of the optimization techniques with an interactive approach in which the designer is in full control of the process. Instead of locating a single solution, clusters of good designs are identified in color, allowing the designer to conduct a more focused search in the areas of high performance design solutions. This method enables the designer to view individual solutions in the vicinity of the local peaks in order to learn more about the interrelationship between design parameters. Interactive visualization tools enable designers to develop a deeper understanding of the search and solution spaces and assist them in evaluating the merits of alternative designs and in their decision making. A by-product of visualization is knowledge discovery, which allows the designer to discover novel solutions that would not have been possible by conventional means.

Unfortunately, the corrosion is detected in bounding boxes, without precisely segmenting the corrosion elements in irregular boundary shapes, and thus it is difficult to assess them quantitatively, such as in terms of corrosion areas and corrosion severity, which are important for engineers to evaluate the performance and condition of an inspection target. In addition, training an effective CNN model requires creating a training data set by labeling the corrosion pixels in each image, which is tedious and labor intensive. This paper presents a semantic segmentation deep learning approach together with an efficient image labelling tool for rapidly preparing large training data sets, and effectively detecting, segmenting, and evaluating corrosions in the images. The image labeling tool was developed by implementing a texture-based unsupervised image segmentation method, integrated with red-green-blue (RGB) feature-based classifier optimization. The tool enables users to construct a pixel-based corrosion classifier with small set of manually labeled images. This small set of labeled images is used for optimizing the pixel-based corrosion classifier to automatically generate corrosion segments for a large number of training images. A CNN model with semantic segmentation feature then is trained for corrosion detection and segmentation. Finally, a corrosion evaluation method is proposed for classifying each pixel of a corrosion segment into user-prescribed categories such as heavy corrosion, medium corrosion, and light corrosion. The integrated approach was tested on images collected by professional inspection engineers. The results indicated that the proposed approach is practically applicable for corrosion assessment for a wide range of industrial facilities and civil infrastructures.

However, none of the available BIM tools and frameworks focuses on modular construction as an industrialized type of construction; thereby, implementation of BIM in these projects is relatively more challenging compared to site-built constructions. In this paper, an information delivery framework is presented for multistory modular buildings that can address both the project-based and product-based nature of these buildings. To develop such a framework, an extension to an already-existing information delivery manual development methodology is proposed in this paper. The extension makes it possible to capture the hierarchy of the building components, which is an important characteristic of modular buildings as manufactured products. This is done by integrating a new component known as a product architecture model (PAM) with other components of the framework in order to capture the information related to industrialized product-based nature of these buildings.

The resulting framework is validated by considering a typical modular building project in the United States and comparing its information flow with the framework.

Early detection of such deviations can help management teams to reallocate resources and take necessary actions to maximize the productivity.

Therefore, the common practice has been to periodically obtain manually generated aggregated productivity reports from sites. These aggregated reports are not available to both site and office management in real time and may lack detailed information. To avoid these drawbacks, the research presented in this paper proposes an automated tunnel construction monitoring system to measure the productivity of the tunnel construction in terms of shift production (meters/shift).

In the case study, an alternative to distance measurement instruments (DMI) was proposed to determine road lengths for interstate highways in North Carolina. In the proposed alternative, the road lengths were calculated by overlaying GIS roadway linework over elevation data-in this case the National Elevation Dataset, which was developed based on U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 min digital elevation models and calculating a centerline roadway slope distance. The results of this approach were collected and compared with DMI lengths to assess the accuracy of the proposed approach.

Therefore, determining the characteristics of curves [both spatial (including location, length, radius) and nonspatial (including traffic volume, signage, pavement type)] is an important task. GIS applications have been developed for evaluating roadway alignments in general and some have focused on horizontal curve assessment. This paper reports on two benchmarking efforts. The first assessed and established the accuracy of three publicly available GIS applications for determining curve spatial characteristics. The second assessed the quality of available GIS roadway line work. The three GIS applications were evaluated for performance accuracy on the basis of a comparison with precisely drawn curves [with radii ranging from 30.5 to 1,524 m (100 to 5,000 ft)]. The line work was evaluated on the basis of a comparison with field measurements from 51 curves [with radii ranging from 61.6 to 1,832.2 m (202 to 6,011 ft)]. The analysis found that the use of a GIS to accurately determine horizontal curve radius and length is possible.

Measuring one or more dimensions for this purpose induces a manual step in the three-dimensional reconstruction process; this increases the effort and reduces the speed of reconstructing scenes, and induces substantial human error in the process due to the high level of measurement accuracy needed. Other ways of measuring such dimensions are based on acquiring additional information by either using extra sensors or specific classes of objects existing in the scene; it was found that these solutions are not simple, cost effective, or general enough to be considered practical for reconstructing both indoor and outdoor built infrastructure scenes. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel method for automatically calculating the absolute scale of built infrastructure PCD. A premeasured cube for outdoor scenes and a sheet of paper for indoor environments are used as the calibration patterns. Assuming that the dimensions of these objects are known, the proposed method extracts the objects\' corner points in two-dimensional video frames using a novel algorithm. The extracted corner points are then matched between the consecutive frames. Finally, the corresponding corner points are reconstructed along with other features of the scenes to determine the real-world scale. To evaluate the performance of the method, 10 indoor and 10 outdoor cases were selected and the absolute-scale PCD for each case was computed. Results illustrated the proposed algorithm is able to reconstruct the predefined objects with a high success rate, while the generated absolute-scale PCD is sufficiently accurate.

In TOD mode, a few traffic patterns that exist in the historical volume data are recognized and used to find the signal timing plans needed to achieve optimum performance of the intersections during the day. Traffic engineers usually determine TOD breakpoints by analyzing 1 or 2 days worth of traffic data and relying on their engineering judgment. The current statistical methods, such as hierarchical and K-means clustering methods, determine TOD breakpoints but introduce a large number of transitions. This paper proposes adopting the Z-score of the traffic flow and time variable in the K-means clustering to reduce the number of transitions. The numbers of optimum breakpoints are chosen based on a microscopic simulation model considering a set of performance measures. By using simulation and the K-means algorithm, it was found that five clusters are the optimum for a major arterial in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. As an alternative to the simulation-based approach, a subtractive algorithm-based K-means technique is introduced to determine the optimum number of TODs. Through simulation, it was found that both approaches results in almost the same values of measure of effectiveness (MOE). The proposed two approaches seem promising for similar studies in other regions, and both of them can be extended for different types of roads.

The need for developing fundamental methods to take advantage of the relative strengths of each technology and data source while dealing with their limitations motivates the development in this paper of data fusion methods for improving materials location estimation. Particular attention is paid to situations in a construction environment in which radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are attached to each piece of material, and the materials may be repeatedly moved around the site. The construction dynamics, the high noise ratio, and the limitations of the utilized sensing systems result in imperfect data that is imprecise and uncertain. A key challenge is using this imperfect data to improve accuracy and precision while maintaining cost-effectiveness and scalability. To address this issue, a hybrid data-fusion method was developed to increase confidence, accuracy and precision, and add robustness to measurement estimates. This hybrid method leverages evidential belief reasoning and soft computing techniques. The experimental results show that the hybrid fusion method outperforms the traditional methods in data fusion for location estimation. This study has successfully addressed the challenges of fusing data from a range of simple to complex sensor sources within a very noisy and dynamic construction environment.

It requires major human efforts and is time-consuming, costly, and human error-prone. To reduce manual efforts in collecting information from construction procedural documents, selecting appropriate sensing techniques to collect data on the jobsite, and giving in-time feedback for progress monitoring and compliance checking, the authors: (1) proposed a semantic rule-based information extraction (IE) method to extract construction execution steps from construction procedural documents automatically; (2) developed a construction procedure and data collection (CPDC) ontology to classify construction site information and provide guidance on selecting sensing techniques for collecting jobsite data based on the extracted information; and (3) proposed a construction procedural data integration (CPDI) framework, which could integrate textual data and sensing data to conduct construction execution steps compliance checking automatically. The proposed IE method offers a novel way to retrieve construction activities (e.g., install door and prepare surface) from the construction procedural documents that are an important source of information but were seldom analyzed in previous research. It focuses on extracting construction execution steps, which supports the incorporation of execution sequence information into construction jobsite management. A novel information classification application based on a newly developed CPDC ontology is provided to support IE. The IE results provide a new instrument for selecting sensing techniques based on different construction site data categories. The proposed method is developed to support a targeted unified CPDI framework that integrates the following: natural language processing (NLP) and sensing techniques to automatically extract, analyze, and process both planned procedures from textual data from construction procedural documents and executed procedures from sensing data of construction jobsites. It also can be extended to any domain applications that contain textual information and site activity information that needs to be matched or compared. In this paper, the authors focus on the NLP-based textual information extraction of the construction procedural documents, introduced the detailed steps involved, and proposed a CPDI framework on top of and as an application of the IE method. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the IE method with a set of open-source specifications. Comparing it to a manually developed gold standard, 97.08% precision and 93.23% recall were achieved using the proposed IE method for the extraction of construction execution steps. A qualitative analysis on sensing technique selection based on the IE results was also performed. The proposed IE method can be applied to the automation of construction site management tasks (e.g., construction monitoring) that integrates both textual information and sensing data to support construction decision-makings.

Before the lift operation, the location and shape data of all immobile objects in the work area are collected by a boom head and stored in track-sector database of the system based on the position parameters of the boom head. During the operation of the lift, the proposed system calculates a three-dimensional safe zone for the crane, including boom, cable, and lift object based on the object data in real time, and the movement and position of the crane including boom, cable, and lift object are consistently monitored and predicted in real time through weighted linear-regression models. If the predicted position of the crane is reaching the boundary of the precalculated safety operation zone, three different levels of decelerations and an emergency stop will be automatically executed in order, according to the distance between crane and the obstacles, by the lifting controller to prevent the crane from potential collisions with immobile obstacles.

Recently, the literature has been mainly concentrated on resource transfer among the activities for decentralized multi-project scheduling problems. Determining the best location of facilities for periodic services is one of the main points in the decentralized multi-projects scheduling problem. Indeed, discovering the best known location can reduce the project completion time, in particular for those projects in which the activities are far from each other and also activity\'s execution takes significant time. This article introduces a novel decentralized resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem considering periodic services. The purpose of this problem is to minimize the cost associated with the project\'s completion times (at the operational level) and the construction cost of resource pool (at the strategic level) at the same time. First, for better illustration of the problem under consideration, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented, which efficiently solves small-size problems in a reasonable time. Then, a fast priority rule-based constructive heuristic algorithm is originally introduced. Finally, by incorporating the proposed heuristic structure, a combinatorial artificial bee colony (CABC) algorithm is developed to solve such large-size problems efficiently. To evaluate the modeling procedures, the computational results and managerial insights on test problems are presented. The results reveal that in decentralized multi-project scheduling problems, by considering the resource pool\'s location the total costs will be reduced.

One plausible solution in formulating a robust plan against such uncertainties is to provide the proper construction duration by utilizing as-built schedules in which past events are stored for similar future projects. Many schedulers thus develop schedules based on similar past schedules, taking into consideration the dynamic construction environment. As a result, construction schedulers normally refer to similar past schedules for their current projects. Few studies on the reuse of past schedules using case-based reasoning (CBR) have been conducted, and those that are available are limited to specific areas of construction such as apartment-building construction and boiler manufacturing. This research has an emphasis on developing a CBR-based general planning tool with higher applicability, which consists of generic attributes with the capability to be customized to the given project. To address this issue, construction planning by CBR (CONPLA-CBR) is presented as a generic planning tool for various types of construction projects. CONPLA-CBR, with the dynamic case approac h and construction schedule data mart, also developed in this research, helps schedulers to utilize past schedules. CONPLA-CBR was not only verified to be of practical utility by experts, but also, because it uses past cases to which the successor relationships pertain, it does not require users to input all relationships. Whereas the proposed CONPLA-CBR generates master schedules at the preconstruction stage, its concept can also be applied to the construction stages to generate more detailed, for example, weekly or monthly, schedules.

Both methods have certain limitations (e.g., it is necessary to directly attach kinematic sensors to machines, and computer vision algorithms are very sensitive to lighting conditions and occlusions). In addition, current methods predict cycle time values once (usually at the beginning of projects) and do not include an auto-update component capable of adjusting results over time and due to variations, such as changes in jobsite conditions or impacts of learning curve, for example. To address these two important issues, the authors propose an audio-based Bayesian system for estimating cycle times of cyclic construction activities. The sounds generated during routine operations of construction equipment and machines are treated as the main source of data for this project, and efficient signal processing and machine learning algorithms are implemented to process recorded audio files at construction jobsites and extract useful information. A robust denoising algorithm was developed to improve the quality of audio files, and Bayesian statistical models are utilized to include historical data for cycle time estimation enhancement.

This paper proposes an approach to provide a framework for generating semantically-rich parametric models for existing assets. Although the geometric information such as length, width, area, and volume can be extracted from PCD, nongeometric data may need to be appended to this to generate genuinely semantically rich models.

Measurement of deformation using digital image correlation is becoming an invaluable tool in civil engineering. Digital image correlation (DIC) is a classic pattern recognition technique in which two images are compared to obtain the relative displacement between them. DIC is widely used in many engineering fields to obtain spatial deformation patterns, albeit with several names. It is also known as particle image velocimetry (PIV), image cross-correlation, block or region matching method, surface displacement analysis, and subregion scanning computer vision. In geotechnical engineering, DIC has also been used by Horii et al. (1998), Guler et al. (1999), and Rechemnacher and Saab (2002). PIV utilizes DIC in measuring flow pattern and velocity distribution by embedding small particles referred to as seeds in the flow path. Measurements are performed using the cross-correlation function on two consecutive images of these particles. PIV often uses flourescent seeds along with a laser source to identify flow characteristics in specified orientations.

In recent years, developments in reinforced-concrete construction have been rapid and sweeping. Therefore, reinforced-concrete construction is an area of construction in which improvements in work methods and labor efficiency could result in major cost savings. The placement of reinforcing bars (rebar) is an integral part of this type of construction. This is an assembly-type operation with fabricated rebar being placed and tied one by one. Process-oriented intelligent planning for the placement of rebar aims to automate development of detailed plans that depict the assembly sequences of individual bar or set(s) of bars. Traditionally, rebar is fabricated, bundled, and delivered without considering their sequential placement. As a result, a considerable amount of time is wasted for searching, identifying, rehandling, etc., of rebar. To eliminate this waste, the rebar has to be delivered according to the need of the assembly process. The two main objectives of this paper are to present: (1) A feature-based and process-oriented planning framework; and (2) an intelligent and computer-aided-design-integrated (CAD-integrated) process-planning system for the placement of rebar.

Until recently, it has been prohibitively time-consuming to evaluate the joints in a road network, and the evaluation of joint load transfer efficiency (LTE) has been restricted to specific project-level applications. This is changing with the advent of the traffic speed deflectometer (TSD), a device that can collect structural information data at a 1-m resolution while moving at traffic speed. The 1-m resolution is adequate to capture the response of the joints to the applied load, but it results in a higher noise level compared with data collected at lower resolutions (e.g., at the typical 10 m). This paper proposes the use of basis pursuit (BP) denoising to extract meaningful information about the joints\' condition from the (noisy) TSD measurements. Weak joints are modeled as spikes (Dirac basis) in the measurements, and the remaining features in the measurements are modeled on a wavelet basis. Combining the two bases (Dirac basis and wavelet basis) results in multiple possible representations of the collected measurements; essentially there are twice as many unknowns as equations to determine these unknowns. BP denoising seeks a representation with a small number of elements from the two bases. Because weak joints are represented best by spikes, BP denoising results mostly in selecting the spikes at the weak joint locations. These identified spikes provide a list of weak joints that can be used to prioritize available resources (e.g., which joints should be investigated further or fixed first).

Frequently, projects do not reach the highest possible production performance due to undersized logistics processes or insufficient storage capacities. In this paper, a flexible simulation framework for analyzing interactions between production and logistics processes on tunneling jobsites is presented. A formal ontology for logistic elements on a tunneling jobsite is developed using SysML formalism. Based on this formulation, single systems elements combined in process chains are analyzed and their influence on production processes is evaluated. The formal system description identifies process dependencies and resource constraints of the system elements. These formulations are implemented in configurable simulation components for construction equipment, storage spaces, and production materials. Using these components, a jobsite simulation model can be created. The jobsite layout is represented at a high level of detail, with geometric shapes used for estimating storage capacities and movement durations. This approach uses discrete event and system dynamic simulation and applies probability functions to inputs representing production process times. Dynamic simulation can reveal unknown impacts of logistical processes on the continuous advance processes of the TBM. A simulation model for TBMs is integrated to determine the demand for supply processes. A fast and effective comparison between different jobsite layouts and logistics strategies is possible due to flexible components.

Among available job analysis methods, biomechanical models have been widely applied to assess musculoskeletal risks that may contribute to the development of WMSDs based on motion data during occupational tasks. Recently, with the advent of vision-based motion capture approaches, it has become possible to collect the motion data required for biomechanical analysis under real conditions. However, vision-based motion capture approaches have not been applied to biomechanical analysis because of compatibility issues in body models of the motion data and computerized biomechanical analysis tools. To address this issue, automated data processing is focused on to convert motion data into available data in existing biomechanical analysis tools, given the BVH motion data from vision-based approaches. To examine the feasibility of the proposed motion data processing, an experiment for both static and dynamic biomechanical analyses was conducted on lifting tasks. The results indicate that vision-based motion capture data-converted as proposed in this paper-can provide a sufficient level of detail on human kinematics to conduct biomechanical analysis, thus allowing for the identification of particular body parts where excessive forces are placed during tasks.

In addition, algebraic (secondary) equations and variables specified the nonlinearity inherent in the system as well as any controls on the primary variables constraining the physical evolution of the system relevant to the problem at hand. The objective of this exercise was to demonstrate that spurious oscillations in the modeling and simulation software solution are numerical aberrations. Furthermore, the numerical DAE solution is absent these same oscillations, exhibits point-wise stability, and converges to the physically correct solution. While the modeling and simulation software employed a fourth-order Runge-Kutta and first-order Euler numerical strategy, the numerical DAE method used a fully explicit, fully implicit, and Crank-Nicolson Euler scheme combined with a fixed-point iteration to resolve the nonlinearity. The Runge-Kutta and numerical DAE solutions deviate markedly when the nonlinearity of the system becomes pronounced. Specifically, spurious oscillations in the numerical DAE solution disappear as the time step is refined. In contrast, they remain for the Runge-Kutta solution. The DAE solution is point-wise stable as the time step is refined and hence is physically correct.

The annual average daily traffic (AADT) data is an important component of transportation design, operation, policy analysis, and planning. The use of traffic volume forecasting models for the characterization, analysis, and estimation of transportation data has proven to be a useful method for reducing high costs, overcoming spatial constraints, and limiting the errors associated with data collection and analysis in transportation planning. The geostatistical kriging technique is a viable method for modeling and forecasting AADT. The degree to which the technique of kriging can be useful in forecasting AADT depends highly on an understanding of the decision-making variables, the relationship between the variables, and the practical limitations of the various kriging techniques and variogram models. This paper applied three different linear kriging techniques [simple kriging (SK), ordinary kriging (OK), and universal kriging (UK)] and five variogram models (nugget effect, spherical, exponential, Gaussian, and power) to characterize and interpolate the annual average daily traffic of Washington State. The statistical errors (i.e., mean error, root-mean-square error, average standard error, mean standardized error, and root-mean-square standardized error) of the resulting output were then compared to determine the most suitable combination of linear spatial interpolation and variogram algorithms for each of the data sets. Ordinary and/or universal kriging combined with the exponential variogram were the most appropriate methods for the 2008 AADT data set, whereas ordinary kriging combined with the spherical variogram and simple kriging combined with the spherical variogram were the most suitable methods for the 2009 and 2010 data sets, respectively. Results from this study suggest that using the same combination of kriging and variogram algorithms to characterize and interpolate different AADT data sets (2008, 2009, and 2010) could lead to suboptimal results.

Drill-and-blast is one of the most common and flexible tunnel construction methods. However, it is complex and challenging because a large amount of data is generated from dispersed, independent, and heterogeneous sources. The tunneling industry still uses traditional project management techniques to manage complex interactions between these data sources that are hardly linked, and independent decisions are often made without considering all the relevant aspects. In this context, tunnel construction exhibits uncertainties and risks due to unforeseen circumstances, intricate design, and ineffective information management. Building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry provides a solution to such issues with effective data information modeling. Existing research has considered a very general BIM semantic model and focused only a small portion of the entire drill-and-blast construction process.

The proposed model was trained and tested on a real data set comprising 42,520 images using different pretrained architectures with various hyperparameter combinations. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model and its potential for crack detection and localization using weakly supervised machine learning methods that can cope with partially labeled data sets.', 'sbekhor@technion.ac.il', '0', '0', '2000-01-01 00:20:24', 38, 1);

In addition, a driver aggressiveness model derived from a lane change vehicle trajectories model was incorporated into the lane change vehicles in the microscopic traffic simulation model. The resulting microscopic traffic simulation model vehicle trajectories were processed through the vehicle dynamics model to account for the vehicle dynamics and the traffic conflicts were identified through the surrogate safety assessment model.

However, there is still a need to advance the current methods for improving the productivity of operations and safety on job sites. The excavator is one of the highly used pieces of equipment on construction sites that needs to be monitored to evaluate both safety and productivity. Knowing the productivity of excavators helps to plan the excavation process more accurately. A long queue of trucks waiting for the excavator(s) means paying more money while the trucks are not being loaded. Moreover, excavators have a higher risk of accidents due to their articulated shape compared to other excavation-related equipment. On the other hand, monitoring an object with four degrees of freedom using sensory data is a very difficult task. Therefore, this research investigates the opportunities to fuse CV-based methods and real-time location systems (RTLSs) and apply stereo vision methods to formulate a comprehensive framework for estimating the three-dimensional (3D) poses of excavators as some of the most widely used equipment on construction sites. Instead of using specialized tools, such as off-the-shelf stereo cameras or markers, this study evaluates the applicability of using the surveillance cameras on construction sites as stereo cameras. Moreover, RTLS data and two or more cameras\' data are fused by synchronizing the time and coordinate systems of the cameras and RTLS to investigate the potential of enhancing the accuracy of the pose estimation system and reducing the computational load.

A data set consisting of more than 87 million pixels was generated from 108 images of concrete surfaces with a variety of surfaces. Transformations from the RGB color space to non-RGB color spaces were performed to increase separability between concrete and background classes and to achieve robustness to changes in illumination. To find the optimal combination of color space and machine learning algorithm, the performance of three machine learning algorithms (e.g., a Gaussian mixture model, an artificial neural network model, and a support vector machine model) in two non-RGB color spaces (e.g., HSI and normalized RGB) was comparatively analyzed. The comparison showed that the combination of the support vector machine algorithm and the HSI color space is superior in detecting concrete structural components in color images, compared with the other five algorithm-color space combinations.

Although these systems improve the visibility of the surrounding environment, detecting potential collisions with workers nearby is still restricted by the limited cognitive capacity of the operator, who is executing tasks that are themselves cognitively effortful. The aim of this study is to propose a real-time warning system using visual data acquired from cameras that are readily available in the heavy equipment to protect the workers from potentially dangerous situations involving equipment operations.

However, when defects of modules are not easily repairable on the construction site, they cause additional cost overruns and delays due to long lead times of refabrication and reshipment. Thus, quality assessment of modular components at the fabrication facility before shipment is very important. The current inspection practices rely on manual measurement, which can be imprecise, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. To address this issue, some research efforts are made on the module inspection techniques (e.g., estimates of geometric properties and surface quality) using laser-scanned data. The accuracy of these techniques relies on the quality (i.e., coverage and resolution) of the scan data. However, ensuring the consistent quality of data is a major challenge as there is little to no research on optimal scan planning for modular components. Therefore, this paper proposes a model-based 3D scan planning method for modular components that ensures user-specified scan quality. Given a 3D computer-aided design (CAD) or building information modeling (BIM) model, scanner property, and user\'s quality requirement, this method automatically computes the input parameters for the laser scanner (i.e., angular step and field of view) and optimal scan positions. It also predicts the scan quality and shows the areas that will not meet the user requirement due to geometric constraints (i.e., self-occluded surfaces). This study was validated through two case studies using two modular-sized structures in a fabrication facility.

Presently, most road networks are modeled based on a link-node structure, in which road segments are modeled as links that start, end, and connect to each other at nodes; detailed information regarding lane and lane connectivity at intersections is lost. To overcome this gap between the link-node-based and the lane-based network representations, both open source and commercial simulation packages had created specific data structures and formats, making it difficult to extend them to convert link-node representations into lane-based network representations and facilitate the sharing of resulting lane models.

Many investigators have used image-processing methods to automate the survey process and to enhance the quality and accuracy of survey results. However, image-processing methods often mistakenly treat oil spillages, shadows, and road markings as distresses because their features are similar to those of distresses. Therefore, in this research, the authors proposed a dual-light inspection (DLI) method to reduce false alarms. The DLI involves four major steps: (1)image capturea pair of images is retrieved from identical positions and orientations, but with different light setups; (2)image subtractionthe two images are subtracted pixel by pixel to obtain a subtracted image that represents the differences between the paring images; (3)image enhancementan edge detection method is applied to retrieve the distress features; and (4)image classificationa classification algorithm is finally used to discriminate between images that include distresses and ones that do not. A field test was conducted to verify the DLI method. A total of 212 pairs of images were captured during nighttime, including images of alligator cracks (42 pairs), manholes (42 pairs), longitudinal cracks (58 pairs), spillages (34 pairs), and road markings (52 pairs). Twenty percent of the images (i.e.,45 pairs) were used as training sets to train the classification model. The remaining images were then used to test the accuracy of the classification model. The accuracy of the DLI method, which uses dual-light image pairs, was compared with that of the traditional method, which uses individual images. The DLI can significantly improve the accuracy in determining spillage (traditional: 18%, DLI: 82%) and road markings (traditional: 8%, DLI: 96%). The DLI is also reasonably accurate in determining other distresses including alligator cracks (traditional: 95%, DLI: 90%), manholes (traditional: 97%, DLI: 100%), and longitudinal cracks (traditional: 62%, DLI: 69%). These results indicate that DLI can become a reliable method for automatic pavement inspection.

An integrated system is proposed for automatically creating 3D building models from building polygons (building footprints) on a digital map. Because most building polygons\' edges meet at a right angle (orthogonal polygon), the integrated system partitions orthogonal building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. In this research, a new scheme for partitioning complicated orthogonal building polygons is proposed. In the digital map, however, not all building polygons are orthogonal. To place parts of a building properly, in either orthogonal or nonorthogonal polygons, the proposed system places parts of a building, such as windows along the inner contour, which is set back from the original building polygon by straight skeleton computation. For a multiple-bounded polygon (a building polygon bounded by outer polygons), a new scheme is also presented for creating a complicated building-shape model or a multilayer building.

Seven different patterns are studied and compared, which leads to the best performance eight-direction pattern in terms of accuracy and robustness for feature extraction of pavement images with cracking; then, a local threshold approach and shape filtering using eccentricity value parameters are applied to enhance the candidate cracks.

There is a close relationship between sliding resistance and characteristics of texture morphology, demanding high precision and comprehensive acquisition of both macrotexture and microtexture morphology.

First, six light sources are adopted to enhance the illumination and eliminate incomplete information retrieval of pavement surface image. Second, a low-rank approximation is proposed in the image processing stage to significantly reduce the interference of noise, highlights, and shadow, resulting in a higher precision of reconstructed pavement surface compared with the existing photometric stereo method using three light sources. Third, unlike the control point-based weighting algorithm, a control point-based surface interpolation algorithm is established, which can further optimizes the precision of the reconstructed surface by combining the effect of global integration with the elevation of positions of relative points. Under testing in indoor conditions, a surface interpolation photometric stereo method with 2,500 control points and using low-rank approximation can effectively measure both macrotexture and microtexture morphology.

The objective of this research study is to analyze the feasibility of three indoor localization technologies for supporting operations and maintenance (O&M) field tasks; namely, wireless local area network (WLAN), radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and inertial measurement units (IMU). These technologies have been selected on the basis of the requirements of the localization needed for supporting O&M field activities. A previous work has been extended, which tested RFID-based locations in an indoor environment, by testing the three selected technologies in the same test bed and using the same hypothesis and fingerprinting approach developed in the previous work. The two main motivations behind using the same test bed and same approach are to have the same baseline to evaluate the performance of the three technologies and to evaluate the performance of RFID-based localization over longer periods. The results in the present study show that RFID-based localization suffers from a decrease in signal strength levels over several years, and that WLAN-based localization suffers from variations in signal strength. They also show that IMU-based localization suffers from drift in the sensors of IMU. Prior knowledge of the layout of a facility can improve the performance of WLAN, RFID, and IMU-based localization.

In this paper, the spatial transferability of NN models in travel demand modeling, especially in mode choice models, is analyzed. This paper first discusses the performance of naive transfer when no data are available in an application context. Then, a NN model adaptation method is proposed using the classification adjustment weight vector when limited local data are available. Using the 2007/2008 Transportation Planning BoardBaltimore Metropolitan Council Household Travel Survey data, five NN models are built using trips within five areas in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore regions. Each of the five NN models is applied to the other four areas to study spatial transferability using both individual-level and aggregate-level performance measures. The result shows that the naive transfer of NN models can perform very well between areas that share many similarities. It also indicates the transferability of NN models is not symmetric. The performance of the proposed adaptation method is evaluated for different sample sizes of local training data. For transfer between areas that have significant differences, the proposed NN model adaptation method can improve performance significantly, even with a small sample size, compared to naive transfer.

Onsite safety observers often assess workers\' severity levels during construction activities. While risk analysis is key to improving long-term construction site safety, omnipresent monitoring is still time-consuming and costly to implement. The recent growth of visual data captured actively on construction sites has opened a new opportunity to increase the frequency of worker safety monitoring. This paper shows that a comprehensive vision-based assessment is the most informative to automatically infer worker severity level from images. Efficient computer vision models are presented to conduct this risk analysis. The method is validated on a challenging image dataset first of its kind. Specifically, the proposed method detects and evaluates the worker state from visual data, defined by (1) worker body posture, (2) the usage of personal protective equipment, (3) worker interactions with tools and materials, (4) the construction activity being performed, and (5) the presence of surrounding workplace hazards. To estimate the worker state, a multitasked recognition model is introduced that recognizes objects, activity, and keypoints from visual data simultaneously, taking 36.6% less time and 40.1% less memory while keeping comparably performances compared to a system running individual models for each subtask. Worker activity recognition is further improved with a spatio-temporal graph neural network model using recognized per-frame worker activity, detected bounding boxes of tools and materials, and estimated worker poses. Finally, severity levels are predicted by a trained classifier on a dataset of images of construction workers accompanied with ground truth severity level annotations. In the test dataset assembled from real-world projects, the severity level prediction model achieves 85.7% cross-validation accuracy in a bricklaying task and 86.6% cross-validation accuracy for a plastering task, demonstrating the potential for near real-time worker safety detection and severity assessment.

This paper presents an approach that determines possible locations of mobile cranes based on discrete-event simulation of crane operations incorporating dynamic behaviors of cranes. This approach starts with identifying a search space for possible crane locations by reasoning about a reachability radius of a crane determined by crane characteristics and the weight of the load to be carried.

The first new algorithm is the extent overlap box (EOB) method that detects interparticle contact, and the second is the capability of adding a uniform-thickness shell to each particle. Parameter analysis has shown that the EOB method leads to a more accurate detection of interparticle contact with a smaller computational cost than the previously used Newton-Raphson method. The uniform-thickness shell provides a customizable tool to control the minimum intersurface distance of particles during the parking process, as well as to simulate processes and microstructure that are dependent on the Euclidean distance from a particle surface. For mortar and concrete, the uniform-thickness shell can represent the observed interfacial transition zone (ITZ) structure. A parallel processing application programming interface (API) was integrated into the Anm model to accelerate the particle placement process by parallel optimization, which results in significant improvements in the packing efficiency on multicore processor systems.

The permeability of the numerically generated porous samples as outputs was determined by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The five most important parameters (porosity, tortuosity, fractal dimension, average pore diameter, and coordination number) were selected as inputs for the permeability prediction. To improve the accuracy, feature selection and ML methods comparisons were conducted. Three feature selection methods based on expert knowledge, correlation coefficient, and importance score were compared. Moreover, a comparison was performed on six ML methods (support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision tree, random forest, gradient-boosting machine, and Bayesian ridge regression) that were optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results indicated that (1) the feature selection based on the expert knowledge obtained a higher performance than the groups based on the correlation coefficient and importance score, implying the importance of expert knowledge on feature selection, and thus on ML performance; (2) artificial neural network with hyperparameter tuning achieved the best performance in predicting permeability; and (3) the optimized ML method outperformed the empirical equations in predicting permeability.

For a system comprising many interconnected components, it captures the probabilistic dependencies between components and system performance, with inference in the BN informing decision making in the management of these systems. However, one of the major challenges in the BN modeling of infrastructure systems is the exponentially increasing computational complexity as the number of components in the system increases. Previously, algorithms have been developed for BN modeling of binary systems. Compared with binary systems, multistate system modeling provides a more detailed description of system reliability and enables the analysis of flow instead of connectivity networks. However, the dimensionality of the problem also increases. This paper advances the state of the art in BN modeling of complex networks by presenting new algorithms for constructing the BN model for multistate components and systems and performing exact inference over these models. The results support reliability assessment of civil infrastructure flow systems. Specifically, the authors present a new lossless compression algorithm for initial construction of the BN model and simultaneous preprocessing of intermediate factors for inference. These significantly reduce memory storage requirements for the BN. Two heuristics are described to further increase computational efficiency. The new algorithms are applied to an example infrastructure system. The ability to conduct inference across the network is demonstrated and performance measured compared to existing algorithms in terms of both memory storage and computation time. The proposed algorithms are shown to achieve exponentially increasing data compression with a stable increased computation time ratio, enabling larger multistate flow networks to be modeled as BNs than previously possible.

Based on the observation of real-world pavement crack characteristics, the proposed multiscale CFE model consists of (1) a CFE along with its geometrical properties that can be represented consistently at different scales, (2) connecting and expanding operations to cluster CFEs from a small to a large scale, and (3) the topological crack representation inside each CFE, including fundamental and aggregated crack properties and CFE geometrical properties. The proposed multiscale CFE model provides crack properties that enable researchers to develop innovative crack classification methods to characterize cracks at different scales and flexibly model crack classifications specified by different state DOTs. In addition, it also delivers the rich and invariant crack properties that enable researchers to develop standardized crack performance measurements. A real-world load cracking classification application based on the logistic regression method has also been developed and tested using the actual pavement data collected near Savannah, Georgia to demonstrate the use of the crack properties extracted from the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model is promising for developing real-world crack classification applications. Finally, future research is recommended.

Conventional methods for measuring the aggregate particle size, such as manual calipers or mechanical sieving, are time consuming and labor intensive. In addition, the accuracy of image processing techniques is severely limited by shadows and heterogeneous backgrounds. Hence, we developed an automatic stereo vision-based inspection system (SVIS) for the identification and shape analysis of coarse aggregate particles. We integrated a cascaded deep learning model into the SVIS to identify the types of coarse aggregate particles under offsite working conditions. Moreover, we combined deep learning and stereo vision techniques to calculate the unit conversion factors and the thickness of each particle to facilitate particle shape analysis. The precision and recall metrics obtained from the training model were 96.0% for particle detection and >= 95.7% for particle segmentation. In the experiment, the proposed inspection system accurately determined the particle size of coarse aggregates with measurement errors of <= 4.96% compared with the ground truth. Thus, the proposed system overcomes the shortcomings of image processing technologies and considerably aids the decision-making process during onsite material inspection.

Although such construction practices have advantages in terms of cost competitiveness and delivery time, they have many issues related to structural integrity and secondary stresses from vibration during transit and misalignment during installation. Therefore, monitoring the vibration, strain, and deformation of the modules using structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques is important. The primary purpose of this study is to explore building information modeling (BIM) techniques to facilitate effective data management and the representation of sensory components of the SHMsystem in a building and to render or visualize the damage or distress in building components based on the interpretation of sensor data. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: (1) an automated sensor-based data acquisition and storage module, which extracts sensor data for a structure from a corresponding relational database; and (2) an automated data and damage visualization module, through which sensor data are interpreted to identify damage or anomalies in the structure and the affected building components are highlighted and tagged in the BIM of the building to facilitate visualization. The damaged or near-damaged elements of the modules are highlighted in the BIM model through color-coding based on predefined threshold strain values. Because detecting buckled or yielded steel members (local damages) in a building or a module is challenging given that these components are often hidden behind fireproof coating and drywall, the proposed SHM-based condition assessment system will contribute-especially in the preinstallation and operational phases-to providing efficient, near-real-time health monitoring of buildings and increasing the efficiency of the structural condition assessment process. These benefits could be particularly useful for modular buildings, for which the modules are constructed in a plant and transported to the site for installation. In these stages, a module may undergo hidden or visible damage, the installed sensors are expected to provide a mechanism to assess such damage, and the entire process can be managed through BIM. Importantly, note that although a similar concept was explored by other researchers to integrate SHM with BIM, the present study provides a more comprehensive methodology through the complete implementation of the system to demonstrate the concept through a case study.

Map-matching (MM) algorithms integrate location data (i.e.,latitude and longitude) obtained from positioning sensors (in this case, mobile GPS) with a digital geographic information system (GIS) road map.

However, deep offshore wind energy is mostly left untapped due to the high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). To address the challenge, individual blade pitch control (IPC) of each blade is necessary to reduce fatigue due to the nonlinear dynamics involving unbalanced nonstationary wind/wave loading. In this paper, a machine learning control (MLC) method is proposed that utilizes a genetic program to selectively evolve promising control law candidates from simulated FOWT sensor data. The proposed method utilizes unique MLC features including an efficient selection of design load cases (DLCs) to accelerate the evolution, DLC-based elitism to identify promising candidates, and the use of internal state feedback to learn effective controller properties across all the target DLCs. These features are used to reduce evaluation time on the complex nonlinear FOWT model. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by reducing fatigue and ultimate loading by 41% under the representative DLCs provided by the Aerodynamic Turbines with Load Attenuation Systems (ATLAS) competition hosted by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). Unlike the methods founded upon black-box models (e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs)], the proposed method provides interpretable results; thus, it can contribute to learning important design features to guide the future controller design. For example, the best individual driven during the feasibility study exhibits a nonlinear proportional controller to a sigmoid like platform pitch signal, which can be a starting point for more advanced IPC design for FOWTs.

Accordingly, those who need to implement these data models in their AEC-related software which often requires that they possess civil engineering domain knowledge, have to chan-e their existing implementations for compliance with these models to account for the latest update.

A spatiotemporal network-based model is developed in this paper which performs dynamic risk analysis on the struck-by-equipment hazard at both entity and network levels. The developed model performs safety risk analysis in a real-time and proactive manner by considering the spatiotemporal interactions among all construction entities (equipment and workers on foot) across the jobsite. Three risk factors of struck-by-equipment hazards were selected, including proximity, blind spots, and velocity. The interactions of the selected factors between entities are quantified and used to generate the network. Three safety leading indicatorsdegree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and relative risk scoreare adopted to represent the risk levels of individual entities and jobsites. The implementation and evaluation of the network-based model with the three leading indicators are conducted and illustrated based on four simulated jobsites.

This study presents two novel four-dimensional (4D) [time and three-dimensional (3D) space] models, a time-sphere model and a time-cuboid model, that are effective in reducing the rate of false alarms. In each developed 4D model, (1)entities\' state information, including 3D position, orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw), and velocity, is acquired and analyzed over time; and (2)the hazardous area around equipment or workers is represented by a sphere or a cuboid with the warning distance adjusted and updated according to the entities\' collected state information; and (3)unsafe-proximity query rules identify and predict contact collisions using relative position, moving direction, speed, and a pairwise 3D unsafe-proximity query.

The obtained reduced alarm percentages imply that on average 65% of the alarms triggered by the most prevalent method can be averted by using the time-sphere model and 81% can be reduced by using the time-cuboid model. Furthermore, three major categories of findings are summarized: model comparison, model analysis, and the relationship between alert zone dimensions and model performance.

By considering three types of entity attributes [i.e.,(1)position, (2)heading/moving direction, and (3)speed], more accurate unsafe-proximity identifications with reduced false alarms can be achieved. The proposed and developed model works via two modules, as follows: (1)state tracking module, and (2)safety rules module. The state tracking module collects construction entities\' states (position, heading, and speed) in real time. The collected states information is analyzed in the safety rules module for unsafe-proximity identifications. Five common situations on construction jobsites are extracted and studied for the development of the safety rules, as follows: (1)static equipment and moving worker, (2)moving equipment and moving worker, (3)moving equipment and static worker, (4)two pieces of moving equipment, and (5)moving equipment and static equipment. The unsafe area around equipment is divided into alert and warning areas which are quantified using forklift as sample equipment. The localization accuracy of the state tracking module and the functional effectiveness of the safety rules module are evaluated, through simulation and a field experiment. Twelve scenarios and 13 subscenarios were designed and incorporated, in the simulation and the field experiment, respectively. The extended Kalman filter combined with the nearest-neighbor method was used in the simulation and a global positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial navigation system sensor was used in the field experiment as the state tracking module. The results suggest that the magnitude of localization accuracy of the extended Kalman filter combined with the nearest-neighbor method and the adopted sensor both are less than 0.7m. Such an accuracy level is acceptable for construction applications. Moreover, the developed safety rules have a strong capability in avoiding false alarms. In some scenarios the developed model can avoid one false alarm for each scan.

Current compaction quality assessment methods, such as graphical reports or simple prediction models, are imprecise and can cause unobserved quality assessment defects. These methods do not comprehensively consider factors that affect the compaction quality because they do not integrate heterogeneous construction data sets collected by different data acquisition systems. In this research, a method of assessing compaction quality on the basis of support vector regression (SVR), the chaos-based firefly algorithm, is presented. The assessment method has three stages. In the first stage, a chaotic firefly algorithm (CFA) is proposed to optimize the SVR hyperparameters. In the second stage, a multisource heterogeneous data integration subsystem based on the compaction monitoring system is designed, in which compaction monitoring data, material source statistical data, and detected data from test pits are integrated. Finally, the optimized SVR is used to evaluate the compaction quality of the storehouse surface. The significance of the proposed method is threefold: first, it integrates both chaos theory and the firefly algorithm to optimize the SVR hyperparameters; second, it integrates heterogeneous construction data, allowing comprehensive consideration of factors that affect the compaction quality; and third, it has high prediction accuracy because it implements structural risk minimization.

However, blurry images are inevitably generated during image collecting by UAVs, as they are caused by the motion of UAVs and other factors. This blur affects the retrieval of crack properties from images and degrades the accuracy and reliability of crack damage assessment. At present, blur detection and blurred image removal are mainly achieved manually, which is inefficient and fallible, especially for large image sets. To address this problem, a novel automatic blur detection method for UAV crack image data sets is proposed. This algorithm defines a blur detection metric named the edge average width difference (EAWD), which is based on the principle of a smaller difference between pixels of a more blurred image. Moreover, it is combined with the characteristics of the crack image itself. By calculating this metric and comparing it with other EAWD values from the same data set, the crack images are judged to be blurred or not. Furthermore, a support vector machine classifier is applied to the aforementioned metrics, serving as the image blur quality evaluator. For proper training and assessment of the proposed approach, an image data set consisting of 1,200 crack images is created, which also contains some thin crack images.

The quality of connections between adjacent precast elements must be ensured to guarantee the overall structural integrity of precast systems. Therefore, the dimensional quality of precast concrete panels should be inspected before they are shipped to construction sites for installation. However, current quality inspection of precast concrete elements primarily relies on manual inspection. Furthermore, the as-built dimensions of precast elements are usually stored in paper sheets or Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to visualize and manage the as-built dimensions. This study develops a technique to automatically estimate the dimensions of precast concrete bridge deck panels and create as-built building information modeling (BIM) models to store the real dimensions of the panels. First, the proposed technique conducts scan planning to find the optimal scanner locations for scan data acquisition. Then, the scan data of the target panel are acquired and preprocessed to remove noise data and to register multiple scans in a global coordinate system. From the registered scan data, the as-built geometries of the target panel are estimated. In the last step, an as-built BIM model is created on the basis of the previously estimated geometries. The proposed technique is validated on a laboratory-scale specimen and a full-scale precast concrete bridge deck panel. The experimental results show that the proposed technique can accurately and efficiently estimate the dimensions of full-scale precast concrete bridge deck panels with an accuracy of 3mm and automatically create as-built BIM models of the panels.

However, the rules to classify cracking are often complicated and subjective, which compromises the reliability of computerized implementation. This study develops a support vector machine (SVM)-based method to intelligently identify cracking types in an automated manner.

However, ordered photo collection requires a strict capture plan and happens only after a specific time interval. Additionally, the reality models demand a considerable amount of processing time. As a result, the construction project status is often unreported between the intervals. The random photos captured daily by construction practitioners from different parts of the projects are helpful in filling this void. Localizing them in the 3D reality model helps to extract valuable information on time for effective construction monitoring. This study develops a system that localizes random photos in reality models using computer vision and deep learning-based approaches. Specifically, given a set of photos and a point cloud pair, a deep learning network for a six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) camera pose regression is trained to take any random photo within the point cloud region and estimate its position and orientation. The network performance is enhanced through data augmentation by another generative adversarial network: the pix2pix generative adversarial network (GAN). Finally, the poses are refined through traditional vision methods such as Perspective-n-Point (PnP) pose computation with random sample consensus (RANSAC).

This is largely due to the difficulties related to obtaining accurate location measurements of the cameras aboard small UAV platforms. To address this research gap, we propose a video analysis methodology for tracking the displacement response of buildings subject to dynamic loads using camera-equipped UAV platforms. The movement of the image sensor on-board the UAV platform is corrected to allow image-by-image natural feature detection and tracking. In this methodology, the image processing procedure does not rely on the camera position and orientation. As such, the approach first corrects for image distortion introduced by UAV drift and subsequently extracts the dynamic displacements of the building by tracking its natural features at the pixel level. Motion-tracking errors are investigated by analyzing the building displacements using pre- and postevent videos. The proposed methodology is validated by monitoring the dynamic response of a full-scale building during a shake table test program. Uniquely, global positioning system (GPS) displacement measurements are independently utilized to validate the proposed UAV video-based method and assess its effectiveness for capturing the dynamic responses of full-scale structures with a level of precision that is sufficient for engineering applications (less than 2 cm root-mean-square errors).', 'tara@ucsd.edu', '15', '18', '2000-01-01 00:20:20', 34, 6);

However, extracting and modeling safety requirements for supporting automated violation detection or safety alert systems remains highly manual. Toward addressing this gap, information extraction provides an opportunity to automatically extract requirements from construction safety regulations for comparisons with field information to detect violations (or predict and prevent violations before they occur).

The proposed information extraction method consists of three main submethods: (1) a deep learning-based method to recognize entities from the regulations, (2) a deep learning-based method to recognize referential ambiguities in the extracted entities, and (3) a named entity normalization method to resolve these ambiguities.

Due to its sound theoretical background and notable influence, this methodology has been successfully applied in many research areas. In order to explore its application in structural damage identification, a new CS-based damage identification scheme is proposed in this paper, by regarding damage identification problems as pattern classification problems. The time domain structural responses are transferred to the frequency domain as sparse representation, and then the numerical simulated data under various damage scenarios will be used to train a feature matrix as input information. This matrix can be used for damage identification through an optimization process. This will be one of the first few applications of this advanced technique to structural engineering areas. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, numerical simulation results on a complex pipe soil interaction model are used to train the parameters and then to identify the simulated pipe degradation damage and free-spanning damage.

Such interpretation served as the foundation of the following traffic analysis. However, inevitable measurement noise and errors originating from multisensor systems pose substantial challenges in achieving accurate map matching. In addition, existing map matching methods are typically inefficient in processing tens of millions of noisy aircraft positioning records generated from large metropolitan airports. In this paper, the authors propose a new map matching algorithm that can achieve computational efficiency and high accuracy in interpreting large-scale and noisy aircraft trajectories on the ground into coherent road representations.

These three components collectively speed up the matching process without losing accuracy.

Consequently, we propose a framework of generic semantic enrichment that includes four fundamental tasks in the context of graphs and a process control mechanism to execute a set of tools in a proper sequence.

The revolving mechanical arm of excavators poses a major risk of contact-driven accidents for workers in its proximity due to its articulated pose. Detecting the 3D pose of excavator arms is thus essential to prevent contact-driven accidents near excavators. Previous works have attempted to estimate 3D excavator poses using sensor-based or computer vision-based methods. However, existing methods require extensive preparation work, such as attaching physical sensors, calibrating stereo cameras, or collecting 3D training data. As a result, existing methods cannot be easily integrated into the current construction workflow and are seldom applied in real-world situations. The authors propose a projection-based 3D pose optimization method that utilizes excavator kinematic constraints to infer 3D excavator poses from monocular image sequences with no dependency on 3D training data. The proposed method first extracts the 2D excavator pose from images using a keypoint region-based convolution neural network. Then, the 2D pose is reconstructed into 3D by enforcing the rigid excavator kinematic constraints (e.g., arm length) and minimizing the 2D reprojection error of the excavator pose. Tests using a 1:14 miniature excavator model showed a 3D position error of 7.3 cm (or 1.03 m when scaled up to real-world dimensions) for keypoints on the excavator pose, demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed method in estimating 3D excavator poses from monocular images. The proximity measuring capacity of the estimated 3D pose was also evaluated, achieving a mean absolute distance error of 4.7 cm (or 0.66 m scaled). The proposed method offers a 3D excavator pose estimation method using only a monocular camera and without relying on 3D training data.

A machine learning approach is designated to address any classification task without requiring the domain knowledge to be explicitly or manually specified in detail. The success of machine learning, however, relies on the quality and suitability of input features. In order to support seamless interoperability of BIM applications, the authors have proposed invariant signatures that uniquely define each AEC object and capture their intrinsic properties. In this paper, the authors combine the use of invariant signatures together with machine learning approach to address BIM object classification. The developed invariant signatures include geometric signatures, locational signatures, and metadata signatures. To test the robustness of their use as machine learning features, the authors created a new BIM object data set with 1,900 AEC objects in five major categories of building elements, including beams, columns, footings, slabs, and walls. The data were manually annotated by independent annotators to ensure the quality. Among those AEC objects in the data set, 1,330 objects (70% of the data) were used as training/development data and 570 objects (30% of the data) were used as testing data. The authors extracted the predefined invariant signatures as features and tested the robustness of them in AEC object classification using different machine learning algorithms. The best-performing algorithm achieved 99.6% F1-measure in the testing data, which outperformed the state of the art (94.9% F1-measure). As a demonstration of the value of such object classification, a comparative experiment was conducted to take off quantities of walls from a student apartment complex, both using the state-of-the-art commercial software and using the object classification-based automation. Consistent results were found between these two quantity takeoff methods, whereas using object classification-based automation further saved time and manual efforts significantly (saved 98.1% of the loading and object selecting time). These results showed that the use of proposed invariant signatures and machine learning algorithms in BIM applications is promising.

To address this gap, the authors proposed a new method for BIM model validation to validate an input Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) model with regard to building code concepts. This validation method was supported by creating invariant signatures of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) objects that capture the geometric nature of the objects. Target concepts from building codes are classified into four categories: (1) explicit concepts, (2) inferable concepts, (3) user-assisted concepts, and (4) system defaults. Identification algorithms are developed for all four categories based on the invariant signatures of AEC objects. An experiment was conducted to test the proposed method on validating five real commercial project models with selected concepts from a current building code.

To address this problem, the authors propose a new data-driven, iterative method that can be used to develop an algorithm to automatically classify each object in an IFC model into predefined categories. The algorithm consists of multiple subalgorithms with each subalgorithm depicting a pattern matching rule that uses inherent features of the geometric representation of an architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) object. The method was tested in an experiment in which IFC models from three different sources were collected and 1,891 AEC objects were extracted and divided into training and testing data for use. By comparing the classification results of the algorithm developed based on training data and applied to testing data with a manually developed gold standard, 84.45% recall and 85.20% precision were achieved in common building element categories, and 100% recall and precision were achieved in detailed beam categories. The sources of errors were found to be (1) different objects sharing the same geometric shape and (2) uncovered geometric shape representation in the training data. By adding locational information into consideration in addition to geometric information and making sure training data covers all geometric shape representations, 100% precision and recall can be achieved for all categories.

This paper studies ways to improve the construction performance level through optimum resource allocation based on the BIM technology method. This paper proposes a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based performance evaluation system for BIM technology for use by construction enterprises. First, this performance evaluation is established with determined input and output variables within the performance evaluation and analysis model. Then, a total of nine construction projects using BIM technology at their construction stages are selected and analyzed using data envelopment analysis models from the literature. Both ineffective and effective technology units are determined, and input redundancy and output sufficiency of the ineffective technical units are analyzed. The results show that among the studied nine construction projects, the overall project performance level is increased above the moderate level; five of them are effective technology units and the remaining four are ineffective ones. Further analysis of the four ineffective technical units indicates that the most severe input redundancies are electronic equipment investment and construction measures fees.

For the last decade, it has gained increasing acceptance in its application to progress monitoring, productivity analyses, and quality assurance. However, a notable downside exists in image processing, especially in outdoor applications such as construction project monitoring: image quality is heavily affected by ambient lighting conditions. Poor or undesirable lighting conditions produce substandard quality images, which generally lead to a high level of errors in the related image processing for information extraction. This paper presents error-correction methods that can improve the image processing results for construction progress monitoring in the postprocessing stage. The methods are applied in the postprocessing stage. The key idea behind the error-correction methods is the concept of priority to classify input images and project information into several categories based on data reliability and intelligently use the classified information for more accurate analyses of the project progress. Tests in real construction sites showed that these postprocessing methods significantly increased the accuracy of image processing-based construction progress monitoring.

Moreover, it aimed to examine whether and how such effects of the emergency broadcast are influenced by its two attributes, namely, the speed rate at which it is broadcasted and the amount of information embedded in it. To achieve these goals, a virtual reality (VR)-based experiment was conducted in which the participants needed to evacuate from a virtual metro station when a fire broke out in the station. During the evacuation, the participants could hear emergency broadcasts that contained different amounts of information and were broadcasted at different speech rates. The results showed that the large majority of participants who received and understood the information conveyed by the emergency broadcast made their wayfinding decisions based on this information, even when it contrasted with their own prior spatial knowledge about the station. The participants also reported in a postexperiment questionnaire that the information conveyed by the emergency broadcast was more important than other sources of information, such as spatial memory and visual cues, for them to complete the evacuation task.

A three-dimensional simulation model for a live-bed bridge scour considering suspended sediment loads is proposed and validated in this paper. The major computational contribution of this new simulation model is the capability of simulating the dynamic equilibrium of inputs and outputs of sediments around bridge piers in a reliable and computationally efficient manner. First, aiming at the discrepancy between clear-water and live-bed scours, a two-phase flow model was applied where the water-sediment mixture flow was described via three conservation laws. The riverbed deformation induced by such water-sediment mixture flow was modeled based on a nonequilibrium sediment transport behavior. Specifically, (1) the developed representations and computational models enable the calculation of the substance exchange between the suspended sediment loads and bed loads in order to determine the geometric profile of the scoured riverbed; and (2) these models also capture the detailed transport behaviors and rates of suspended sediment loads and bed loads in order to support a quantitative derivation of the flux of such substance exchange. By doing so, the riverbed as a fluid model boundary can be updated in real time by tracing the calculated exchange flux; thus, the scour depth was dynamically simulated. Second, a simulation model of bridge scour was established with the consideration of suspended sediment loads. The advantages of adopting the proposed model were quantitatively and qualitatively validated by comparing to the experimental results on three aspects: (1) the suspended load distribution, (2) local scour depth, and (3) scour hole profile. Finally, case studies were conducted to parametrically investigate both the influence of the concentration of suspended sediment loads on the scouring and the validity of commonly used empirical formulas. The results assist engineers and researchers to better understand the impacts of suspended sediment loads on the bridge scour. The entire research indicates that the proposed live-bed bridge-scour modeling methodology enables simulation and analysis of the complex substance exchange and transport behaviors of suspended sediment loads during the live-bed scouring. Such a model could thus assure more accurate and reliable predictions and ought to be widely applied.

In this methodology, two surrogate models involving kriging and support vector regression (SVR) are used concurrently in one updating cycle to propose new design samples. The error estimation capability of Gaussian variance (i.e., mean squared error) intrinsically furnished with kriging is successfully imported to SVR. Specifically, the surrogate-based design-updating methodology is introduced first, where two infill criteria, the mean squared error (MSE), and expected improvement (EI), are employed for balancing the exploration and exploitation of surrogate approximations. Three evaluation approaches, the normalized maximum absolute error (NMAE), normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), and correlation coefficient (CR), are adopted to evaluate the model performance. In one updating cycle, each constructed surrogate model, kriging, or SVR, provides a set of new design points based on the adopted infill criteria, respectively. This sequential updating procedure is constrained with the computational budget and the global tolerance (the requirements of precision) prescribed based on the prior knowledge of the dataset. Then, two benchmark nonlinear functions are demonstrated following the procedure developed. Two typical civil engineering applications (bridge deck-wave interaction and aerodynamics optimization) are carried out for demonstrating the effective performance of both kriging and SVR-based updating strategy.

The ability to process building code requirements in all parts and formats is necessary for an automated code compliance checking system to achieve full coverage of checkable building code requirements. To address this gap, the authors propose a semiautomated information extraction and transformation method. The proposed method can extract building code requirements in tables and convert extracted information to logic rules. Automated code compliance checking systems can utilize the logic rules. The proposed method includes two main steps: (1) tabular information extraction, and (2) rule generation. The tabular information extraction semiautomatically detects the layout of tables, extracts building code requirements from tables, and transforms extracted information to databases. The rule generation step automatically generates logic rules that can be directly executed by logic reasoners. The rule generation step also provides options for users to further refine the generated rules. The development of the tabular information extraction algorithm takes an iterative approach. An experiment was conducted to develop a tabular information extraction algorithm from a section of existing code. The primary version of the algorithm correctly processed 91.67% of tables in a second sample section. After iterative refinements, the updated tabular information extraction algorithm correctly processed all tables in this section. The rule generation algorithm correctly generated logic rules that successfully represented the applicable building code requirements for a testing building, a convenience store in Texas based on the tabular information.

This paper presents a new imaging-based intelligent method for quantitatively rating the corrosion states of weathering steel bridges. Images are characterized by image texture analysis using two-dimensional wavelet decomposition, from which both the local and global energy distributions of each detail subimage are extracted as representative features. To enhance the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) in corrosion state classification, a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is developed to obtain the optimal parameters of the SVM. A comparative study indicates that PSO-SVM can achieve better classification accuracy rates than artificial neural network.

High crowdedness can result in dangerous working conditions, negative workers\' behaviors, lack of concern for safety climate, and productivity loss due to saturated and insufficient working areas where workers can perform. An automatic computer vision-based technique could be a novel solution for crowdedness monitoring for proactive safety management. Non-intrusiveness and applicability in a complex outdoor environment are critical considerations for device selection on construction sites. Accordingly, a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera is selected to detect worker-centric crowdedness. This device is less intrusive for workers than wearable sensors and is also widely applied in outdoor construction sites considering complex working areas and various light conditions. Previous RGB camera-based methods for crowdedness detection simplify the proximity estimation process by assuming that the construction site is a two-dimensional (2D) planar surface. These methods use image pixels for proximity calculation. Such simplification can cause a distortion in three-dimensional (3D) spatial proximity due to 2D projection of 3D entities. Moreover, previous methods suffer from lack of reproducibility due to the view variance of a 2D camera. To address these problems, a 3D spatial crowdedness estimation method is developed by generating a 3D space for proximity and crowdedness calculation from 2D video frames. This method has been validated in laboratory and field tests. Results indicate that the proposed method enables the estimation of 3D spatial proximity between two workers within an error of 0.45 m in a real-time and view-invariant manner from a 2D video.

The approach reasons with a facility-specific model-based information repository in order to identify an accurate set of applicable causes for a reported HVAC-related problem in the large search space of possible causes and to retrieve related facility and system information.

Traditionally, construction workers in Hong Kong start work at 8: 00 a.m. and finish work at 6: 00 p.m., having one hour lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and an additional break of 30 min at 3: 15 p.m. Construction workers can beat the heat by starting earlier to avoid some extreme conditions, which may occur at certain times of a day. By maintaining the current practice of 9-h working duration for a day, 21 additional work patterns with different start and finish times were proposed and evaluated by the developed optimization algorithm. An optimized schedule (direct-work rate of 87.8%) of working from 7: 30 a.m. to 12: 00 p.m. with a 20 min break at 9: 40 a.m., having lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and working from 1: 00 p.m. to 5: 30 p.m. with a 30 min break at 3: 00 p.m. is proposed. The proposed work pattern not only maximizes direct-work rates but also minimizes the occurrence of heat stress on construction site. This will enable policy makers to derive solid guidelines for working in hot weather. Because the proposed work pattern is developed specifically for the construction industry, more work is needed to further investigate other industries and other climates to provide a holistic view in the future.

Such building-geometry definitions are widely used for various engineering applications such as energy simulation, lighting analysis, and facility management. However, quality issues (i.e., geometric and nongeometric issues) of SBs have been widely reported, which makes it necessary to validate the SBs before retrieving them from IFC models for relevant applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of reliable mechanisms/tools to automatically evaluate the quality of SBs, especially the geometric quality. This study proposes a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach to automatically detect geometric errors in SBs. The approach checks SBs space by space in terms of whether each space is correctly bounded by its SBs. The geometric errors in the set of SBs of a space that the approach can detect include gaps, overhangs, and overlaps between SBs as well as incorrect surface normal directions of SBs. To accelerate the ray tracing process in the approach, the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree is implemented to spatially index SBs of each space. The approach is evaluated with extensive performance tests in terms of robustness and efficiency. The results show that the approach can robustly and efficiently detect all four types of geometric errors even in extreme cases and that the AABB tree helps speed up the approach significantly for large-scale IFC models with many complex spaces.', 'u3004315@connect.hku.hk; sanghoon.lee@hku.hk', '7', '7', '2000-01-01 00:20:20', 34, 2);

This paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework for damage detection in a steel pipe under environmental and operational variations. The pipe was instrumented with piezoelectric wafers that can generate and sense ultrasonic waves. Damage was simulated physically by a mass scatterer grease-coupled to the surface of the pipe. Benign variations included variable internal air pressure and ambient temperature over time. Ultrasonic measurements were taken on three different days with the scatterer placed at different locations on the pipe. The wave patterns are complex and difficult to interpret, and it is even more difficult to differentiate the changes produced by the scatterer from the changes produced by benign variations. The sensed data were characterized by 365 features extracted from a variety of signal-processing techniques. Automated feature selection methods were then developed using an adaptive boosting algorithm to identify the most effective features for damage detection. With the selected features, five machine-learning classifiers were formulated based on adaptive boosting and support vector machines and achieved 98.5-99.8% average accuracy during random testing and 84.2-89% average accuracy during systematic testing.

One such application is the automated toll collection system. Here, the vehicles need to be accurately classified and verified, as the tolling amount depends on the vehicle type. There are several sensors that can do this under the homogeneous traffic conditions, with limited types of classes, existing in western countries. However, the traffic in countries like India is heterogeneous with the vehicle composition having wide variety of vehicles of varying static and dynamic characteristics. There is no classification solution available, which is efficient, accurate and cost effective, for such traffic. To address this, the present study develops an efficient and accurate vehicle classification system, keeping tolling applications as a case study, under heterogeneous traffic conditions. Out of the sensors used for automatic vehicle identification at toll plazas, inductive loop detectors (ILD) have high sensitivity and cost effectiveness and hence is selected in this study. This paper describes an efficient and novel methodology with time series, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, for vehicle classification at toll plazas. The proposed methodology has four phases namely; signal denoising, signal segmentation, feature extraction and classification. In the signal denoising phase, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based denoising was implemented. A moving standard deviation algorithm was developed for signal segmentation to obtain vehicle signatures. The segmented signatures were processed through wavelet analysis to obtain features that can be used for training in the feature extraction phase. Supervised support vector machines (SVM) was used to build the vehicle classification algorithm. Unsupervised k-means method was also implemented for clustering vehicle signatures, for cases where the actual vehicle class labels are not available.

The VAS uses patterns obtained from measured 3D acceleration changes by status of a victim. A Naive Bayes classifier is employed for both VPS and VAS: for localization in between the fingerprinting map and for recognition of activities to be used for status assessment.

The actual health states of these poles are known from autopsies conducted after the testing, forming a ground-truth for supervised classification. In the proposed method, a data fusion level extracts the main features from the sampled stress wave signals using power spectrum density (PSD) estimation, wavelet packet transform (WPT), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD).

However, the diverse and dynamic nature of construction activities makes it difficult to unobtrusively collect worker behavior data for analysis. To address this issue, an automatic workload approach is proposed for the first time to continuously assess worker body joints using image-based three-dimensional (3D) posture capture smart insoles, and biomechanical analysis to provide detailed and accurate assessments based on real data instead of simulation. This approach was tested in an experiment, indicating that the method was able to automatically collect data concerning the workers\' 3D posture, estimate external loads, and provide the estimated loads on key body joints with an error rate of 15%. In addition to helping prevent construction workers\' ergonomic risks, the method provides a new data collection approach that may benefit various behavior research fields related to construction safety and productivity management.

Approximately 75% of struck-by fatalities are caused by inappropriate spatial-temporal relationships between construction workers and heavy equipment. Construction safety can be improved if the location and movement of heavy equipment are tracked in real time. However, detecting and tracking heavy equipment with kinematic joints and changing poses, such as excavators, is still a challenge for vision-based sensing methods. This study proposes to detect and track excavators using stereo cameras based on hybrid kinematic shape and key node features. Specifically, templates of excavator components are synthesized for detection following kinematic constraints of each component. Thereafter, a fast directional chamfer matching algorithm is used to detect the excavator components, and the detected components are articulated at the key nodes. Finally, the three-dimensional positions of the key nodes are tracked through triangulation to depict the excavator movements. Results from field experiments demonstrated that concatenating the detected components following a matching order enhances the detection performance. It is also found that the stereo triangulation enables efficient tracking of excavator movements by targeting at the key nodes.

This paper introduces a new drop-flow algorithm that automates the detection and decomposition of GPR signatures into feature components in two-dimensional scans. Commencing at a strip of pixels from the top of the edge of the scan image, the algorithm mimics the motion of a raindrop falling or flowing as it touches the edge pixels of the image. The movement of the raindrop completes the decomposition of the GPR signature when it touches the ground (i.e.,the bottom of the edge image).

Humans can readily see traffic congestion, and can hear traffic noise, but inevitably they are much less aware of odorless, invisible, silent air pollution. Therefore, quite naturally people, whether the general public or transport professionals, struggle to visualize air pollution from traffic, and will find it particularly difficult to visualize changes in air pollution levels resulting from changes in traffic conditions because of the implementation of various urban transport schemes. Hence, there is always a risk of the air quality impacts of potential urban transport schemes being underappreciated. Therefore, this paper contributes to the knowledge by devising a new three-dimensional (3D) visualization approach for modeled air quality before and after the implementation of potential urban transport schemes. Using the Dunkirk area of the City of Nottingham in the United Kingdom as a case study, research has been undertaken to integrate an air pollution dispersion model for the pollutant with a 3D digital city model. The modeled concentrations, before and after the implementation of an urban transport scheme, were represented in the 3D city model at various heights above the ground: first, as 3D point shapes; second, as 3D planar surfaces; and finally, as 3D volumetric clouds. The 3D volumetric clouds approach used the analogy of people\'s perceptions of gray clouds in the sky as representing undesirable weather, and hence provided an intuitive 3D visualization of all the modeled concentrations, at and above the ground surface, in a single 3D virtual scene. Benefits have been identified in enhancing the level of understanding of the pollution dispersion using this new approach to visualization. This has allowed the visualization process to be used in the development of future traffic scenarios that could be used to alter the design of a proposed transport scheme to increase its air quality benefits. This 3D visualization approach was found to be applicable to other transport schemes in different parts of the City of Nottingham.

The classification relies on video data (movement trajectories) collected in urban intersections. The approach is based on the discrimination of the shapes of the speed profiles of each road-user type, more precisely, the discrimination between the speed movement patterns of vehicles and the ambulatory characteristics of pedestrians. The collected movement-trajectory data are represented as time series. The classification is performed using singular value decomposition and reconstruction of the time series. Two complementary methods are proposed based on the quality evaluation (correlation score) of the reconstructed trajectories. In the first method, a threshold-based decision procedure is applied.

These uncertainties can have significant effects on environmental decision making. Traditionally, probabilistic methods have been used to study uncertainties; however, recently, more comprehensive methods are used in the treatment of uncertainty. These methods are capable of addressing uncertainty in the form of vagueness, ambiguity, and conflict, which cannot be studied efficiently using probabilistic frameworks. The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST) is one of the popular methods that can provide a unified platform to address data conflict and incompleteness. In this paper, the use of DST to model and propagate the uncertainty arising from two snow water equivalent data sets with a high degree of conflict (DST conflict k = 0.74) is demonstrated. In DST, on the basis of the nature of data, e.g., the degree of conflict, different combination rules are applicable. Here, four DST combination rules are applied including Dempster-Shafer, Yager, mixture, and the proportional conflict redistribution rule number 6 (PCR6). The outcomes from these rules are compared, and their effects on subsequent decision-making are discussed. Considering the specific condition of the data used, i.e., high-conflict data with limited quality information, results indicate that mixture and PCR6 rules are more appropriate. The resultant uncertainty-driven data set is subsequently used as input into an illustrative hydrologic model demonstrating a method for propagating uncertainty. In addition, the issues of resolving conflict for less contradicting data sets, the dependency between bodies of evidence, and modeling incompleteness are also discussed.

The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to study the impact of road network structure, ATIS, and VMS on transport performance, and (2) to improve transport performance by modifying road network structure and ATIS market share. First, it is assumed that hybrid traffic can employ real-time ATIS and VMS information. If VMS facilities are installed and function on some main roads, a VMS attenuation factor and traffic information quantity are formulated and employed to define the coefficient for VMS impact on vehicles. Using the impact coefficient and link disutility, a new formulation of link  length for path-size attributes is proposed. Second, based on a path-size logit (PSL)-stochastic user equilibrium model, multilevel programming to maximize travel time reliability via road link capacity degradation (two types of degradation are differentiated: active and passive) and ATIS market share control is established. Third, a path-based solution algorithm is established by embedding the method of successive averages within the framework of an evolutionary algorithm. The model formulation and algorithm are analyzed using the Nguyen and Dupuis network. Within the framework of the evolutionary algorithm, investigations of several scenarios indicate that transport performance can be significantly enhanced by setting the remaining road links to be potentially degradable after the inevitably degraded links are identified, adding VMSs to the transport network, and exogenously determining the penetration and compliance rates of ATISs. For the three matrices of relatively high general demand, the travel time reliability of the specific origin-destination (OD) pair can be improved by rates of 29.83, 31.36, and 56.54%, and the total expected travel time of the whole network and the specific OD pair is reduced.

Analogous to a filtering algorithm that only preserves the useful signals, the proposed 3D shadow modeling is a general-purpose algorithm that can transform the raw 3D pavement data into a binary domain in which the amount of unneeded data, such as texture variations and noises in the original 3D data, can be reduced effectively and the remaining descended patterns then become distinctive. Bidirectional lighting is the essential concept specifically used in the 3D shadow modeling to find shadowed areas that are lower than the local surroundings. With the projection angle changes from 0 to 90 degrees, the proposed 3D shadow modeling can generate diverse solutions from being extremely sensitive to extremely insensitive. In other words, the proposed 3D shadow modeling can satisfy varying needs on the basis of sensitivity. In complement to the detection of various descended patterns on pavement surface, the proposed 3D shadow modeling can be employed to detect ascended patterns once the original 3D pavement surface is vertically inverted. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed 3D shadow modeling is an efficient algorithm and can yield a high level of precision (92.37%) and recall (92.93%) for the detection of typical descended patterns (potholes, cracks, joints, and grooves) on all selected 3D pavement images.

This paper proposes an improved architecture of CrackNet called CrackNet II for enhanced learning capability and faster performance. The proposed CrackNet II represents two major modifications on the original CrackNet. First, the feature generator, which provides handcrafted features through fixed and nonlearnable procedures, is no longer used in CrackNet II. Consequently, all layers in CrackNet II have learnable parameters that are tuned during the learning process. Second, CrackNet II has a deeper architecture with more hidden layers but fewer parameters. Such an architecture yields five times faster performance compared with the original CrackNet. Similar to the original CrackNet, CrackNet II still uses invariant image width and height through all layers to place explicit requirements on pixel-perfect accuracy. In addition, the combination of a convolution layer and a 1x1 convolution layer was repeated in CrackNet II to learn local motifs with different sizes of local receptive fields. CrackNet II was trained with 2,500 diverse example images and then demonstrated to outperform the original CrackNet. The experiment using 200 testing images showed that CrackNet II performs generally better than the original CrackNet in terms of both precision and recall. The overall precision, recall, and F-measure achieved by CrackNet II for the 200 testing images were 90.20, 89.06, and 89.62%, respectively.

The techniques of precision recall and confusion matrix are used to determine effectiveness of the developed system of algorithms.

Compared with the original 3D shadow modeling (3D Shadow Modeling I), this improved 3D shadow modeling (3D Shadow Modeling II) presents algorithmic improvements to eliminate noises by inspecting the general lighting behaviors at the specified local neighborhood centered at each individual pixel. In 3D Shadow Modeling II, bidirectional lighting and local neighborhood inspection, which are the two fundamental procedures of 3D Shadow Modeling II, are repeated with various rotation angles to detect descended patterns of arbitrary orientations. With respect to the detection of pavement joints and grooves, the proposed 3D Shadow Modeling II inspects the general lighting behaviors at a long one-dimensional (1D) local neighborhood centered at each image pixel. Through inspections at sufficiently long 1D local neighborhoods, 3D Shadow Modeling II is capable of eliminating noises more efficiently and does not require any subsequent procedures to further remove noises in most cases. To support intensive computations resulting from the long length of the 1D local neighborhood, a massively parallel computing method using a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU) is developed in the paper for improvement of computational efficiency at two orders of magnitude. According to the experiments on 200 3D testing images, 3D Shadow Modeling II can produce consistently high precisions and recalls over 90% for almost all testing images. The overall precision and recall for testing images with joints are 98.58 and 97.46% respectively, while the overall precision and recall for testing images with grooves are 96.49 and 93.87% respectively. It is anticipated that further research and development will demonstrate that the proposed 3D Shadow Modeling II would be more competitive than 3D Shadow Modeling I in detecting other descended patterns such as cracks and potholes, once the local neighborhood for inspection is defined properly to take advantage of the geometric features of the target descended patterns.

This paper proposes a multiagent-based approach to provide real-time support to the staff of construction projects. Collision avoidance is achieved by informing the crane operators about potential collisions and by providing motion replanning for crane operations. During the planning stage, a three-dimensional (3D) model of the static environment is created, and collision-free motion plans are generated by the agents for the cranes, considering engineering constraints and operation rules. During actual construction work, all mobile objects are tagged when entering the monitored area. A site state agent uses a real-time location system (RTLS), such as an ultra-wideband (UWB) system to collect location data, calculates the poses of the objects on site, and sends this information to other agents. By using this real-time updated information, agents can detect potential collisions and replan the path for the cranes for collision avoidance. A coordinator agent coordinates the movement of cranes by deciding their priorities. The site state agent, coordinator agent, and crane agents can communicate and negotiate with one another to make better decisions. The framework of the multiagent system is described in detail, and a prototype system is developed. Three case studies are used to verify and validate the proposed approach. The benefit of using the agent system is that real-time collision avoidance can be achieved by providing more awareness of the site situation and decision making through communication and negotiation between multiple agents, which results in safer and more productive work environment.

In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and an IFC model from a real building.

Compared to construction productivity, design productivity is much more difficult to measure because design is an iterative and innovative process. Today, with rapid extension of building information modeling (BIM) applications, tremendous volumes of design logs have been generated by design software systems, such as Autodesk Revit. A systematic approach composed of a detailed step-by-step procedure is developed to deeply mine design logs in order to monitor and measure the productivity of the design process. A pattern retrieval algorithm is proposed to identify the most frequent design sequential patterns in building design projects. A novel metric for measuring design productivity based on the discovered sequential patterns is put forward. A large data set of design logs, provided by a large international design firm, is used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that: (1) typically, each designer executes specific commands more than any other commands; for instance, it is shown for a designer that the accumulative frequency of three commands can reach up to 56.15% of the entire number of commands executed by the designer; (2) a particular sequential pattern of design commands (\\ pick lines -> \\trim/extend two lines or walls to make a corner -> \\finish sketch) has been executed 2,219 times, accounting for 46.75% of instances associated with the top five discovered sequential patterns of design commands; (3) the identified sequential patterns can be used as a project control mean to detect outlier performers that may require additional attention from project leaders; and (4) productivity performance within the discovered sequential patterns varies significantly among different designers; for instance, one of the designers (designer #6 in the case study) is identified as the most productive designer in executing both Patterns I and II, whereas another designer (Designer #1) is found to be the most productive designer in executing both Patterns III and IV. It is also uncovered that designers, on average, spend less time running the most observed sequential patterns of design commands as they gain more experience.

Therefore, as nonintrusive and accurate solutions, various vision-based methods have been proposed to track entities in construction sites and obtain their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates. However, most existing vision-based methods realize 3D localizations by basing entity matching on the epipolar line, which brings instability in entity matching due to the calculation error of the epipolar line or failure to match entities when multiple entities are located on the same epipolar. To solve this problem, a novel framework based on reidentification is proposed to automatically match workers across two camera views, thereby obtaining their 3D coordinates in construction sites. In this framework, deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms are firstly used to detect and track workers in two camera views. Then, the reidentification (ReID) algorithm is applied to utilize tracked workers\' visual features to match the workers across both two camera views and different frames. As a result, for every matched pair, the worker\'s pixel locations in two camera views can be obtained to calculate the 3D coordinates through triangulation. The implementation of videos recorded from a real construction project proves the feasibility and accuracy of this framework. Specifically, through utilizing the ReID algorithm to match workers, the framework achieves competitive results on workers matching with precision, recall, and accuracy of more than 99%, 93%, and 93%.

Two solution methods are presented, both employing a decomposition approach that eliminates the need for recursive computations. The first is an exact decomposition with branch-and-cut methodology, and the second is a hybrid genetic algorithm that evaluates each chromosome\'s fitness based on optimal objective values to the time-dependent maximum flow subproblem.

Moreover, the potential of neural networks has not been fully utilized although some detection methods have used deep learning. This paper for the first time proposes a multiclass transportation asset detection and pixel-wise segmentation model on two-dimensional images, based on region-based convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN) with a feature pyramid network (FPN).

When establishing an effective prediction slope model, analysis factors such as slope angle, slope height, potential sliding body height and inclination, and cohesion and friction angle of each potential sliding surface need to be considered. As the results of an example design show, there is an appropriate regularity between analysis factors and kernel functions. For example, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is suitable for the geometry factors of a rock slope analysis, whereas the Sigmoid kernel function is better than RBF for analyzing the cohesion and friction angle of the back potential sliding surface; likewise, the linear kernel function is suitable for the material factors of a bottom sliding surface analysis. For these reasons, a combination of kernel functions is necessary for an overall analysis of complex rock slope problems. A comprehensive kernel function based on the analysis of different factors is proposed in this paper. Notably, the maximum absolute error of the test results using this comprehensive kernel function is only 0.1698, meaning that a comprehensive kernel function better embodies the failure mechanism of the rock slope when building a support vector machine (SVM) prediction model.

Several parameters need to be determined in the use of DE, including population size, N; mutation weighting factor, F; crossover rate, CR, and a particular mutation strategy. It has been demonstrated that the search behavior of DE is especially sensitive to the F and CR values. These parameters need to be fine-tuned for different optimization problems because they are generally problem-dependent. A self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) algorithm is proposed to optimize the design of WDSs.

Four WDS case studies have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SADE algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits good performance in terms of solution quality and efficiency.

The analysis of the energy consumption of cutter head drives is thus essential for power planning and control in shield tunneling operations and can help determine shield performance and efficiency. The accurate prediction of energy consumption, which involves complex coupling and nonlinear parameters, has become a challenging task for site managers and tunnel engineers. A hybrid technique that combines least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for analyzing energy consumption is proposed in this study. An adaptive Gaussian kernel function-based LS-SVM is used to establish the relationship between energy consumption and identified factors. The parameters of the LS-SVM model can be optimally determined using a nature-inspired intelligent PSO algorithm to improve prediction accuracy. This method is validated in the first Han River Crossing Urban Metro Tunnel Project in China with a complex urban environment. The relative importance of each factor in the PSO-based LS-SVMmodel is also compared with the results of the sensitivity analysis. Results show that the proposed method can be applied as a feasible and accurate tool for energy consumption audit in urban shield tunneling projects.

However, issues existing in this type of methodology have not yet been fully addressed. Early studies adopted image intensity data for crack detection, assuming the crack pixels are darker than their surrounding pixels. However, when the intensity image suffers from shadows, blemishes, or poor contrast between cracks and surrounding surface, this assumption is compromised. Another issue exists in the image preprocessing stage. Traditional methods, such as median filtering and surface fitting, are used for background correction and crack enhancement purposes. Because most of these preprocessing techniques require subjective parameters such as kernel size of the filter, their performance can be influenced by different images and operating personnel. Moreover, conventional crack detection methods such as edge detection usually do not provide an enclosed crack boundary. This leads to difficulties in extracting individual cracks and estimating the associated cracking properties. To address these issues, an automated crack-detection method that utilizes frequency domain filtering and contouring analysis on three dimensional (3D) laser image range data is proposed. In the image preprocessing stage, frequency domain filtering techniques are applied to remove surface variations (or oscillations), image noises, and grooved patterns. In the proposed methodology, the relationship between the width of a crack and the cutoff frequency of the image filters is derived. The filter parameters are designed based on the physical characteristics (e.g., crack width, groove spacing, and orientation), thus having less subjectivity. A systematic crack detection methodology based on contouring analysis and a set of logics and criteria is proposed to extract enclosed crack boundary and provide accurate detection results under noise contamination and surface variations. Experimental study of crack detection on bridge deck surfaces is performed.

There is sparse literature on network pruning methods, potentially due to the rapid improvement of computing resources and the proprietary nature of such problems for service providers. However, this issue reemerges due to applications on small devices and travel behavior studies that require repeated running of route search routines. To ensure the soundness of travel behavior studies and route guidance applications that rely on such routines, different methods need to be evaluated based on real routes chosen by travelers, which represents a gap in literature. A bounding box method is proposed for efficient pruning of large networks and expediting search for the shortest path. The method is evaluated using real-world trips tracked by global positioning system (GPS). It is observed that an appropriate subnetwork can greatly improve the efficiency of path-finding algorithms without losing much accuracy.

The results indicated that the proportional buffer is superior to the usually used uniform buffer, considering the balance between efficiency and accuracy. The proportional buffer methodology is expected to be useful in developing such innovative solutions as route guidance applications for drivers of connected vehicles where small devices perform the bulk of the computing task.

In the proposed framework, construction projects are conceptualized as metanetworks composed of different nodes (i.e., human agents, information, resources, and tasks) and links. The effects of uncertain events are translated into perturbations in the nodes and links of project metanetworks. These uncertainty-induced perturbations are reflected as transformations in a project\'s topological structure, and thus negatively affect the efficiency of the project\'s metanetwork. The extent of the variation in the efficiency of a project\'s metanetwork is used to determine the extent of vulnerability to uncertainty. The application of the proposed framework is shown in an illustrative case study related to a tunneling project. In the case study, various scenarios related to different uncertain events were simulated through the use of dynamic network analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The illustrative case study demonstrated the application of the proposed framework for predictive assessment and proactive mitigation of vulnerability to uncertainty based on evaluation of dynamic interactions between various entities and networks in construction projects.

As a result, a realistic risk of cognitive load related to the wayfinding information processing starts to emerge. As cognition-driven adaptive wayfinding information systems become increasingly used to overcome challenges of cognition overload due to overwhelming information, a practical and noninvasive method to monitor and classify cognitive loads during the processing of wayfinding information is needed. This paper tested a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based method to identify cognitive load related to wayfinding information processing. The method provides a holistic fNIRS signal analytical pipeline to extract hemodynamic response features in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for cognitive load classification. A human-subject experiment (N = 15) based on the Sternberg working memory test was performed to model the relationship between fNIRS features and cognitive load. Personalized models were evaluated to capture individual differences and identify unique contributing features to each person. The results showed that the fNIRS-based model can help classify cognitive load changes driven by the different levels of task difficulty with satisfactory performance (avgerage accuracy rate 70.02% +/- 4.41%). The findings also demonstrated that personalized models, instead of universal models, are needed for classifying cognitive load based on neuroimaging data. fNIRS has considerable advantages over other neuroimaging methods in cognitive load classification given its robustness to motion artifacts and the satisfactory predictability.

However, the paradigm shift from using paper-based media to electronic media requires better handling of unstructured information, as a computer is more adept at processing structured information. It is observed by the writers that many existing information systems in the construction industry simply mimic paper-based construction documents, not just in presentations but also in data structures, such as request for information (RFI) forms developed by many existing software vendors. The writers thus question whether enough attention has been put into understanding the impact of the paradigm shift on data management for construction documents. This paper argues that a construction document such as a RFI is usually used by construction professionals to serve particular business purposes, which restricts the content of such a document. Consequently, some types of unstructured information make references implicitly or explicitly to certain types of information that are often well structured such as building or project management information. Further, the occurrence of such cross references is constant and stable among different instances of the same type of documents. A major challenge is to properly capture, represent, and utilize such knowledge in order to improve information processing for construction professionals. Text analysis and statistical analysis are applied by this study to determine the patterns of the occurrences for certain types of concepts that are related to building components, contract documents, or project management in unstructured content.

This characteristic of the industry requires that AEC education shall foster multidisciplinary collaboration skills of students. On the other hand, many AEC education programs have started using information and communication technologies (ICTs) to facilitate teaching and learning such as distance learning. One of the challenges in a computer-mediated learning environment arises from the need for computer systems to determine whether a common understanding regarding a certain subject is established among a group of students. To achieve this goal, ICT needs to be able to detect changes in the knowledge structure of students in order to provide better mediation. This paper presents a study on the development of a concept similarity measure that has less computational complexity than graph-based similarity analyses. The similarity measure is intended to determine the similarity of multiple knowledge structures [e.g., concept maps (CMAPs)] of students. The concept similarity measure is developed based on the feature-based method in which propositions associated with a concept are considered as features of the concept. Therefore, the similarity of concepts can be measured by comparing the propositions of the concepts. In addition, since concepts are the key component of a knowledge structure, the common understanding of students can be determined by measuring the similarity of concepts in the knowledge structure of the students. The proposed measure is evaluated by (1) comparing it with the Dice coefficient for analyzing two sets of concepts; (2) analyzing its performance in a generic case of four CMAPs; and (3) applying it to a case using photovoltaic system as an example. In this case, results are intuitively obvious so that calculation results can be corroborated by human judgment. Finally, the concept similarity measure is applied to derive the similarity of CMAPs in the case study. Based on the initial evaluations, this study shows that the proposed measure has demonstrated promising features for determining the similarity of multiple knowledge structures or the common understanding of students. However, when the number of knowledge structures increases, concept similarity analyses become more complicated because uncertain situations arise due to ambiguous human perception to propositions that are shared by multiple concepts. Future research is thus needed to understand and clearly define concept similarity in those situations.

The framework of the proposed method has three major parts: a numerical water quality model, a neural network technique, and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical model is used to generate desirable output for training and testing sets, and the neural network is used as a universal functional mapping tool to approximate the input-output response of the numerical model. The Monte Carlo simulation then uses the neural network to generate numerical realizations based on a probabilistic distribution of parameters, thus obtaining a probabilistic distribution of the simulated state variables. By embedding a neural network into the conventional Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed approach significantly improves upon the conventional method in computational efficiency. The proposed approach has been applied to uncertainty and risk analyses of a phosphorus model for Triadelphia Reservoir in Maryland. The results of this research show that the NNMC approach has potential for efficient uncertainty analysis of water quality modeling.', '', '33', '41', '2000-01-01 00:20:02', 16, 2);

Multiple crews means that an activity can be performed simultaneously in several units by hiring additional crews, whereas fixed logic indicates that for each activity the units assigned to the same crew must be performed by a fixed construction sequence. Existing research works use heuristic methods to solve the problem without formulating an explicit model for further analysis. In this paper, we adopt the mixed-integer programming approach to construct an exact model. To handle large-size problems, an approximate model with reduced number of constraints and variables is further presented. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the exact model is capable of finding optimal solutions for medium-size problems in a reasonable amount of time, and the approximate model produces good feasible solutions for large-size problems in an accepted length of time.

Despite a need to understand how design elements of urban living impact our psychological well-being (e.g., stress), very little research has used quantitative, objective tools to measure how existing or proposed urban development impacts the human experience. In this study, we leverage advances in biometric sensing to measure psychophysiological responses to a variety of urban forms using highly controlled virtual, rather than costly and difficult to control, real-life settings. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that certain urban form characteristics impact human psychophysiology. To do so, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) in 35 participants exploring virtual environments that varied in building height and the presence of greenery (e.g., trees). Based on EEG metrics that are sensitive to stress, we found that urban environments with greenery and lower height buildings were associated with less stress. Overall, our results suggest that biometric measures of brain states, combined with virtual environments, can be utilized to assess the effects of urban elements on people\'s psychological well-being and guide the redevelopment and planning of urban environments.', 'zz1658@nyu.edu; semiha@nyu.edu; ardafna@ar.technion.ac.il; clayton.curtis@nyu.edu', '2', '3', '2000-01-01 00:20:21', 35, 3);

This problem involves coordinating the use of limited site space to accommodate temporary facilities so that transportation cost of materials is minimized. The layout problem considered in this paper is characterized by affinity weights used to model transportation costs between facilities and by geometric constraints that limit their relative positions on site. The proposed genetic algorithm generates an initial population of layouts through a sequence of mutation operations and evolves the layouts of this population through a sequence of genetic operations aiming at finding an optimal layout. The paper concludes with examples illustrating the strength and limitations of the proposed algorithm in the cases of (1) loosely versus tightly constrained layouts with equal levels of interaction between facilities, (2) loosely versus tightly packed layouts with variable levels of interactions between facilities; and (3) loosely versus tightly constrained layouts. In most problems considered where the total-objects-to-site-area ratio did not exceed 60%, the algorithm returned close to optimal solutions in a reasonable time.', '', '74', '80', '2000-01-01 00:20:02', 16, 2);
